Reexamination of all 29 mutations and polymorphisms thus far described in HGO shows that these nucleotide changes are not randomly distributed ; the CCC sequence motif and its inverted complement , GGG , are preferentially mutated . These analyses also demonstrated that the nucleotide substitutions in HGO do not involve CpG dinucleotides , which illustrates important differences between HGO and other genes for the occurrence of mutation at specific short-sequence motifs .

We report herein the occurrence of three separate phenotypes within a single family with a novel 3-base pair deletion of codon 153 or 154 of the peripherin / RDS gene . DESIGN  Case reports with clinical features , fluorescein angiography , kinetic perimetry , electrophysiological studies , and molecular genetics . SETTING  University medical centers . PATIENTS  A 75-year-old woman , her two daughters ( aged 44 and 50 years ) , and her 49-year-old son were screened for peripherin / RDS mutations because of the presence of multiple phenotypes within the same family . RESULTS  The mother presented at age 63 years with a profoundly abnormal electroretinogram ( ERG ) and adult-onset retinitis pigmentosa that progressed dramatically over 12 years , with marked loss of peripheral visual field . One daughter developed pattern macular dystrophy at age 31 years . At age 44 years , her ERG was moderately abnormal but her clinical disease was limited to the macula . Another daughter presented at age 42 years with macular degeneration and over 10 years developed the clinical picture of fundus flavimaculatus . Her peripheral visual field was preserved but her ERG was moderately abnormal . The son had onset of macular degeneration at age 44 years . Pericentral scotomas were present and the ERG was markedly abnormal . Fluorescein angiography revealed punctate pigment epithelial transmission defects . CONCLUSIONS  A 3-base pair deletion of codon 153 or 154 of the peripherin / RDS gene can produce clinically disparate phenotypes even within the same family . . \n "}}

Fewer than half of the splicing mutations involved the canonical AG splice-acceptor site or GT splice-donor site . A higher percentage of mutations occurred at less stringently conserved sites , including silent mutations of the last nucleotide of exons , mutations in nucleotides other than the conserved AG and GT in the consensus splice sites , and creation of splice-acceptor or splice-donor sites in either introns or exons . These splicing mutations led to a variety of consequences , including exon skipping and , to a lesser degree , intron retention , activation of cryptic splice sites , or creation of new splice sites . In addition , 5 of 12 nonsense mutations and 1 missense mutation were associated with deletion in the cDNA of the exons in which the mutations occurred . No ATM protein was detected by western blotting in any AT cell line in which splicing mutations were identified . Several cases of exon skipping in both normal controls and patients for whom no underlying defect could be found in genomic DNA were also observed , suggesting caution in the interpretation of exon deletions observed in ATM cDNA when there is no accompanying identification of genomic mutations . . \n "}}

In addition to the epidemiologic data , molecular genetic studies suggest that inactivation of the APC tumor suppressor may be involved in hepatoblastoma tumorigenesis . A major function of APC is the downregulation of beta-catenin , a transcription-activating protein with oncogenic potential . In an ongoing immunohistochemical study of beta-catenin expression in sporadic cases of tumor types that are associated with adenomatous polyposis coli , we observed increased beta-catenin levels in the cytoplasm and in the nuclei of three investigated hepatoblastomas . Sequencing of exon 3 of the beta-catenin gene ( CTNNB1 ) revealed an activating mutation in one of the tumor samples . Our data indicate for the first time that beta-catenin accumulation may play a role in the development of hepatoblastoma and that activating mutations of the beta-catenin gene may substitute biallelic APC inactivation in this tumor type .

RFLP analysis using the proteolipid protein ( PLP ) gene probe was uninformative in this family . A prenatal diagnosis on a chorionic villus sample ( CVS ) was carried out using single-strand conformation polymorphism ( SSCP ) analysis of a variant in exon 4 of the PLP gene . The fetus was predicted to be unaffected . Sequencing of the exon from the CVS , the predicted-carrier mother , and the obligate-carrier grandmother revealed an A-to-C change at nucleotide 541 in the two women but not in the fetus . As this change results in a Thr-to-Pro change at amino acid 181 in a region of the gene predicted to be part of a transmembrane segment , it was concluded that this was the mutation causing the disease in this family . In addition , in a second family , an exon 5 variant band pattern on SSCP analysis was shown by sequencing to be due to a T-to-C change at nucleotide 668 . This results in a Leu-to-Pro change in a carrier mother and in her two affected sons . These results provide further examples of mutations in PLP that cause Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease and illustrate the value of SSCP in genetic analysis . . \n "}}

A very high level of instability is observed through successive generations and the size of the repeat is generally correlated with the severity of the disease and with age at onset .

We generated transgenic mice carrying large human genomic sequences with 20 , 55 or > 300 CTG , cloned from patients from the same affected DM family .

Moreover , a high level of instability , increasing with age , can be observed in tissues and in sperm . Although we did not observe dramatic expansions ( or big jumps over several hundred CTG repeats ) as in congenital forms of DM , our model carrying > 300 CTG is the first to show instability so close to the human DM situation .

Patients with familial APC ( FAP ) carry germ-line mutations in the APC gene and develop multiple colorectal adenomas and subsequent carcinomas early in life . The severity of the disease correlates with the position of the inherited APC mutation ( genotype-phenotype correlation ) . Together with the fact that both germ-line and sporadic APC mutations cluster in the central region of the APC gene , this points to a dominant negative effect of certain APC mutants . Loss of APC function was recently shown to result in enhanced beta-catenin- / Tcf-mediated transcription in colon epithelial cells . Here , we provide experimental evidence for a dominant negative effect of APC gene products associated with severe polyposis . Wild-type APC activity in beta-catenin- / Tcf-mediated transcription was strongly inhibited by a mutant APC that is truncated at codon 1309 . In contrast , mutant APC gene products that are associated with attenuated polyposis ( codon 386 or 1465 ) interfered only weakly with wild-type APC activity .

We show here that an evolutionary analysis is a key to understanding the biology of a housekeeping gene . From the alignment of the amino acid ( aa ) sequence of 52 glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) species from 42 different organisms , we found a striking correlation between the aa replacements that cause G6PD deficiency in humans and the sequence conservation of G6PD  two-thirds of such replacements are in highly and moderately conserved ( 50-99 % ) aa ; relatively few are in fully conserved aa ( where they might be lethal ) or in poorly conserved aa , where presumably they simply would not cause G6PD deficiency .

We isolated several mutant PAH cDNA clones from a PKU carrier individual and showed that they contained an internal 116 base pair deletion , corresponding precisely to exon 12 of the human chromosomal PAH gene . The deletion causes the synthesis of a truncated protein lacking the C-terminal 52 amino acids .

To determine the molecular basis of the deletion , the mutant chromosomal PAH gene was isolated from this individual and shown to contain a GT-- greater than AT substitution at the 5 splice donor site of intron 12 .

The ALD locus has been mapped to Xq28 , like the red and green color pigment genes . Abnormal color vision has been observed in 12 of 27 patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy ( AMN ) , a milder form of ALD . Furthermore , rearrangements of the color vision gene cluster were found in four of eight ALD kindreds . This led us to propose that a single DNA rearrangement could underlie both ALD and abnormal color vision in these patients . Study of 34 French ALD patients failed to reveal a higher than expected frequency of green / red visual pigment rearrangements 3 to the red / green color vision gene complex . The previous report of such rearrangements was based on small numbers and lack of knowledge that the frequency of \" abnormal \" color vision arrays on molecular analysis was twice as high as expected on the basis of the frequency of phenotypic color vision defects . The red / green color pigment ( R / GCP ) region was studied by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis in 14 of these patients , and we did not find any fragment size difference between the patients and normal individuals who have the same number of pigment genes . The R / GCP region was also analyzed in 29 French and seven North American ALD patients by using six genomic DNA probes , isolated from a cosmid walk , that flank the color vision genes . No deletions were found with probes that lie 3 of the green pigment genes . One of the eight previously reported ALD individuals has a long deletion 5 of the red pigment gene , a deletion causing blue cone monochromacy . This finding and the previous findings of a 45 % frequency of phenotypic color vision defects in patients with AMN may suggest that the ALD / AMN gene lies 5 to the red pigment gene and that the frequent phenotypic color vision anomalies owe their origin to deleted DNA that includes regulatory genes for color vision . It is possible , however , that phenotypic color vision anomalies in AMN may be phenocopies secondary to retinal or neural involvement by the disease . The single case of blue cone monochromacy may therefore be a fortuitous coincidence of two diseases . . \n "}}

We generated mice in which two loxP sites flank part of Piga exon 2 . After crossbreeding with female mice of the EIIa-cre strain , the floxed allele undergoes Cre-mediated recombination with high efficiency during early embryonic development . Because of X chromosome inactivation , female offspring are mosaic for cells that express or lack GPI-linked proteins . Analysis of mosaic mice showed that in heart , lung , kidney , brain , and liver , mainly wild-type Piga is active , suggesting that these tissues require GPI-linked proteins .

OBJECTIVE  To analyze Japanese patients clinically diagnosed as having XLRS formutational changes in the XLRS1 gene . METHODS  Ten patients with XLRS underwent full ophthalmologic examination , including slitlamp biomicroscopy and dilated funduscopy . Genomic DNA was isolated from leukocytes , and all exons of the XLRS1 gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and analyzed using a direct sequencing method . RESULTS  Point mutations in the XLRS1 gene were identified in all 10 patients . The mutations were identical in each of 2 pairs of brothers . Six of the point mutations represented missense mutations , 1 was a nonsense mutation , and 1 was a frameshift mutation . Five of the mutations are newly reported herein . CONCLUSIONS  The discovery of new point mutations in this study increases the available information regarding the spectrum of genetic abnormalities and clinical manifestations of XLRS . However , the limited data failed to reveal a correlation between mutation and disease phenotype . CLINICAL RELEVANCE  Identification of mutations in the XLRS1 gene and expanded information on clinical manifestations will facilitate early diagnosis , appropriate early therapy , and genetic counseling regarding the prognosis of XLRS . . \n "}}

Among these patients , 49 different mutations-including 10 deletions , 2 insertions , 22 amino acid substitutions , 3 nonsense mutations , 9 splice-site defects , and 3 complex mutations-were found . All of the patients with SLS were found to carry mutations . Nineteen of the missense mutations resulted in a severe reduction of FALDH enzyme catalytic activity when expressed in mammalian cells , but one mutation ( 798G-- > C [ K266N ] ) seemed to have a greater effect on mRNA stability . The splice-site mutations led to exon skipping or utilization of cryptic acceptor-splice sites . Thirty-seven mutations were private , and 12 mutations were seen in two or more probands of European or Middle Eastern descent . Four single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) were found in the FALDH gene . At least four of the common mutations ( 551C-- > T , 682C-- > T , 733G-- > A , and 798 + 1delG ) were associated with multiple SNP haplotypes , suggesting that these mutations originated independently on more than one occasion or were ancient SLS genes that had undergone intragenic recombination .

On the basis of the observation that aminoglycoside treatment can suppress stop codons in cultured cells , we tested the effect of gentamicin on cultured muscle cells from the mdx mouse - an animal model for DMD that possesses a premature stop codon in the dystrophin gene . Exposure of mdx myotubes to gentamicin led to the expression and localization of dystrophin to the cell membrane . We then evaluated the effects of differing dosages of gentamicin on expression and functional protection of the muscles of mdx mice . We identified a treatment regimen that resulted in the presence of dystrophin in the cell membrane in all striated muscles examined and that provided functional protection against muscular injury . To our knowledge , our results are the first to demonstrate that aminoglycosides can suppress stop codons not only in vitro but also in vivo . Furthermore , these results raise the possibility of a novel treatment regimen for muscular dystrophy and other diseases caused by premature stop codon mutations . This treatment could prove effective in up to 15 % of patients with DMD . . \n "}}

Attempts to define the clinical significance of BRCA mutation status in ovarian cancer have produced conflicting results , especially regarding survival . OBJECTIVE  To determine whether hereditary ovarian cancers have distinct clinical and pathological features compared with sporadic ( nonhereditary ) ovarian cancers . DESIGN AND SETTING  Retrospective cohort study of a consecutive series of 933 ovarian cancers diagnosed and treated at our institution , which is a comprehensive cancer center as designated by the National Cancer Institute , over a 12-year period ( December 1986 to August 1998 ) . PATIENTS  The study was restricted to patients of Jewish origin because of the ease of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genotyping in this ethnic group . From the 189 patients who identified themselves as Jewish , 88 hereditary cases were identified with the presence of a germline founder mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 . The remaining 101 cases from the same series not associated with a BRCA mutation and 2 additional groups ( Gynecologic Oncology Group protocols 52 and 111 ) with ovarian cancer from clinical trials ( for the survival analysis ) were included for comparison . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES  Age at diagnosis , surgical stage , histologic cell type and grade , and surgical outcome ; and response to chemotherapy and survival for advanced-stage ( II and IV ) cases . RESULTS  Hereditary cancers were rarely diagnosed before age 40 years and were common after age 60 years , with mean age at diagnosis being significantly younger for BRCA1- vs BRCA2-linked patients ( 54 vs 62 years ; P = . 04 ) . Histology , grade , stage , and success of cytoreductive surgery were similar for hereditary and sporadic cases . The hereditary group had a longer disease-free interval following primary chemotherapy in comparison with the nonhereditary group , with a median time to recurrence of 14 months and 7 months , respectively ( P < . 001 ) . Those with hereditary cancers had improved survival compared with the nonhereditary group ( P = . 004 ) . For stage III cancers , BRCA mutation status was an independent prognostic variable ( P = . 03 ) . CONCLUSIONS  Although BRCA-associated hereditary ovarian cancers in this population have surgical and pathological characteristics similar to those of sporadic cancers , advanced-stage hereditary cancer patients survive longer than nonhereditary cancer patients . Age penetrance is greater for BRCA1-linked than for BRCA2-linked cancers in this population .\n "}}

We have developed a screening protocol for identifying WASP gene alterations in genomic DNA and have identified a spectrum of novel mutations in 12 additional unrelated families .

Two mutations creating premature termination codons were associated with lack of detectable mRNA on Northern blots .

A T-cell line from a WAS patient contained two independent DNA alterations , a constitutional frameshift mutation , also present in peripheral blood leukocytes from the patient , and compensatory splice site mutation unique to the cell line .

Because this gene is expressed in both rods and cones , mutations in the rds gene might be expected to cause degeneration affecting either the scotopic or photopic systems . Mutations at codon 172 of the rds gene have been identified in three families with autosomal dominantly inherited , progressive macular dystrophy . METHODS  Affected individuals underwent ophthalmic examination , scotopic perimetry , dark adaptometry , measurement of color-contrast sensitivity , and electroretinography to characterize the photoreceptor dysfunction . RESULTS  In all but one affected member , symptoms of progressive central visual loss developed in the third or fourth decade of life accompanied by central scotoma and well-demarcated atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium and choriocapillaris of the macula . In general , cone and rod thresholds were elevated , and color-contrast sensitivity was absent in the central visual field . Peripherally , the scotopic sensitivities were normal , as was the recovery from bleach . Cone electroretinograms were diminished in amplitude , and delayed in all affected adults except one . Rod electroretinograms were normal or near normal in amplitude , and had normal implicit times . Affected asymptomatic children had macular changes , abnormal color-contrast sensitivity , and reduced pattern and cone electroretinograms . CONCLUSION  These results indicate that mutations in the rds gene can be expressed as a macular dystrophy , with evidence of primary cone dysfunction and preservation of peripheral rod function . . \n "}}

The complex is necessary for the stabilization of the discs , which are renewed constantly throughout life , and which contain the visual pigments necessary for photon capture . Mutations in Prph2 have been shown to result in a variety of photoreceptor dystrophies , including autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa and macular dystrophy . A common feature of these diseases is the loss of photoreceptor function , also seen in the retinal degeneration slow ( rds or Prph2 Rd2 / Rd2 ) mouse , which is homozygous for a null mutation in Prph2 . It is characterized by a complete failure to develop photoreceptor discs and outer segments , downregulation of rhodopsin and apoptotic loss of photoreceptor cells . The electroretinograms ( ERGs ) of Prph2Rd2 / Rd2 mice have greatly diminished a-wave and b-wave amplitudes , which decline to virtually undetectable concentrations by two months . Subretinal injection of recombinant adeno-associated virus ( AAV ) encoding a Prph2 transgene results in stable generation of outer segment structures and formation of new stacks of discs containing both perpherin-2 and rhodopsin , which in many cases are morphologically similar to normal outer segments . Moreover , the re-establishment of the structural integrity of the photoreceptor layer also results in electrophysiological correction . These studies demonstrate for the first time that a complex ultrastructural cell defect can be corrected both morphologically and functionally by in vivo gene transfer . . \n "}}

DNA probes from either the 5 or 3 end of the gene were used to detect a 250-kb EagI restriction fragment in DNA from unaffected individuals .

The detection and mapping of the translocation breakpoints of all three retinoblastoma patients to within the putative RB1 gene substantiated the authenticity of this candidate sequence and demonstrated the utility of FIGE in detecting chromosomal rearrangements affecting this locus . \n "}}

All published mutations affect the signal peptide or the neurophysin-II carrier protein and are presumed to interfere with processing of the preprohormone , leading to neuronal damage . We studied an unusual Palestinian family consisting of asymptomatic first cousin parents and three children affected with neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus , suggesting autosomal recessive inheritance . All three affected children were homozygous and the parents heterozygous for a single novel mutation ( C301- > T ) in exon 1 , replacing Pro7 of mature AVP with Leu ( Leu-AVP ) . Leu-AVP was a weak agonist with approximately 30-fold reduced binding to the human V2 receptor . Measured by radioimmunoassay with a synthetic Leu-AVP standard , serum Leu-AVP levels were elevated in all three children and further increased during water deprivation to as high as 30 times normal . The youngest child ( 2 years old ) was only mildly affected but had Leu-AVP levels similar to her severely affected 8-year-old brother , suggesting that unknown mechanisms may partially compensate for a deficiency of active AVP in very young children . . \n "}}

Genotype-phenotype studies of mouse models for DMD show position-specific effects of the mutations upon the phenotype  mice with 5 defects of dystrophin have normal ERGs , those with defects in the central region have a normal b-wave amplitude associated with prolonged implicit times for both the b-wave and oscillatory potentials , and mice with 3 defects have a phenotype similar to that seen in  DMD / BMD patients . The mouse studies suggest a key role for the carboxyl terminal dystrophin isoform , Dp260 , in retinal electrophysiology . We have undertaken a systematic evaluation of DMD / BMD patients through clinical examination and review of the literature in order to determine whether the position-specific effects of mutations noted in the mouse are present in man . We have found that , in man , a wider variation of DMD defects correlate with reductions in the b-wave amplitude . Individuals with normal ERGs have mutations predominantly located 5 of the transcript initiation site of Dp260 . Our results suggest that the most important determinant in the ERG b-wave phenotype is the mutation position , rather than muscle disease severity . Forty-six per cent of patients with mutations 5 of the Dp260 transcript start site have abnormal ERGs , as opposed to 94 % with more distal mutations . The human genotype-phenotype correlations are consistent with a role for Dp260 in normal retinal electrophysiology and may also reflect the expression of other C-terminal dystrophin isoforms and their contributions to retinal signal transmission . . \n "}}

We found constitutional deletions in 29 of 30 VHL patients in this group using cosmid and P1 probes that cover the VHL locus . We then tested six phenotypically normal offspring from four of these VHL families  two were found to carry the deletion and the other four were deletion-free .

A comparison of DNA-based and enzyme-based tests.\tBACKGROUND AND METHODS . The prevention of Tay-Sachs disease ( GM2 gangliosidosis , type 1 ) depends on the identification of carriers of the gene for this autosomal recessive disorder . We compared the enzyme-based test widely used in screening for Tay-Sachs disease with a test based on analysis of DNA . We developed methods to detect the three mutations in the HEXA gene that occur with high frequency among Ashkenazi Jews  two mutations cause infantile Tay-Sachs disease , and the third causes the adult-onset form of the disease . DNA segments containing these mutation sites were amplified with the polymerase chain reaction and analyzed for the presence of the mutations . RESULTS . Among 62 Ashkenazi obligate carriers of Tay-Sachs disease , the three specific mutations accounted for all but one of the mutant alleles ( 98 percent ) . In 216 Ashkenazi carriers identified by the enzyme test , DNA analysis showed that 177 ( 82 percent ) had one of the identified mutations . Of the 177 , 79 percent had the exon 11 insertion mutation , 18 percent had the intron 12 splice-junction mutation , and 3 percent had the less severe exon 7 mutation associated with adult-onset disease . The results of the enzyme tests in the 39 subjects ( 18 percent ) who were defined as carriers but in whom DNA analysis did not identify a mutant allele were probably false positive ( although there remains some possibility of unidentified mutations ) . In addition , of 152 persons defined as noncarriers by the enzyme-based test , 1 was identified as a carrier by DNA analysis ( i . e e . , a false negative enzyme-test result ) . CONCLUSIONS . The increased specificity and predictive value of the DNA-based test make it a useful adjunct to the diagnostic tests currently used to screen for carriers of Tay-Sachs disease . \n "}}

We performed a sperm typing study of five MJD patients of French descent and analysis of the pooled data shows a ratio of mutant to normal alleles of 379  436 ( 46 . 5  53 . 5 % ) , which does not support meiotic segregation distortion .

Likelihood-based analysis of segregation distortion in the single sperm data using the SPERMSEG program also showed no support for segregation distortion at the gamete level in this patient population .

Studies using DM patient materials have often produced confusing results . Therefore , to study the effects of the DM mutation in a controlled environment , we have established a cell culture model system using C2C12 mouse myoblasts . By expressing chimeric reporter constructs containing a reporter gene fused to a human DMPK 3-UTR , we identified both cis and trans effects that are mediated by the DM mutation . Our data show that a mutant DMPK 3-UTR , with as few as 57 CTGs , had a negative cis effect on protein expression and resulted in the aggregation of reporter transcripts into discrete nuclear foci . We determined by deletion analysis that an expanded ( CTG ) ( n ) tract alone was sufficient to mediate these cis effects . Furthermore , in contrast to the normal DMPK 3-UTR mRNA , a mutant DMPK 3-UTR mRNA with ( CUG ) ( 200 ) selectively inhibited myogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts . Genetic analysis and the Cre- loxP system were used to clearly demonstrate that the myoblast fusion defect could be rescued by eliminating the expression of the mutant DMPK 3-UTR transcript . Characterization of spontaneous deletion events mapped the inhibitory effect to the ( CTG ) ( n ) expansion and / or the 3 end of the DMPK 3-UTR . These results provide evidence that the DM mutation acts in cis to reduce protein production ( consistent with DMPK haploinsufficiency ) and in trans as a riboregulator to inhibit myogenesis . . \n "}}

Although greater than 400 variants have been described based on clinical and biochemical criteria , little is known about the molecular basis of these G6PD deficiencies . Recently , the gene that encodes human G6PD has been cloned and sequenced , which enables us to examine directly the heterogeneity of G6PD at the DNA level . During the past 10 years , we examined the G6PD activity in 21 , 271 newborn Chinese infants ( 11 , 400 males and 9 , 871 females ) and identified 314 ( 2 . 8 % ) males and 246 ( 2 . 5 % ) females having low G6PD activity . The G6PD gene from 10 randomly selected affected individuals and their relatives was polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) amplified , subcloned , and sequenced . Our results indicate that at least four types of mutation are responsible for the G6PD polymorphism in Taiwan . The first type of mutation ( 487 G----A ) was found in an affected Chinese with a G to A change at nucleotide 487 , which results in a ( 163 ) Gly to Ser substitution . The second type of mutation ( 493 A----G ) is a novel mutation that has not been reported in any other ethnic group and was identified in two affected Chinese . This mutation causes an A to G change at nucleotide position 493 , producing an ( 165 ) Asn to Asp substitution . Interestingly , the 487 G----A and 493 A----G mutations create Alu I and Ava II recognition sites , respectively , which enabled us to rapidly detect these two mutations by PCR / restriction enzyme ( RE ) digestion method . The third mutation ( 1376 G----T ) was found in four affected Chinese . This mutation causes a G to T change at nucleotide position 1376 that results in an ( 459 ) Arg to Leu substitution . The 1376 G----T mutation seems to be the dominant allele that causes G6PD deficiency in Taiwan . Finally , two affected Chinese were identified as having the fourth mutation ( 1388 G----A ) .

METHODS  We discovered a mutation caused by a C-- > T transition at base-pair 1158 of the GALT gene that results in a serine-to-leucine substitution at codon 135 ( S135L ) . We developed a method with which to screen populations for its prevalence . We compared galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase among erythrocytes , leukocytes , and transformed lymphoblasts , as well as total body oxidation of D- ( 13C ) -galactose to 13CO2 among three genotypes for GALT ( S135L / S135L , Q188R / Q188R , and Normal / Normal ) . RESULTS  We found a 48 % prevalence of the S135L mutation among 17 black American patients with classic galactosemia and a 1 % prevalence in a population of 50 black Americans without galactosemia . The S135L mutation was not found in 84 white patients with G / G galactosemia nor in 87 white control subjects without galactosemia . We found normal whole body oxidation of D- ( 13C ) -galactose by the patient homozygous for S135L and various degrees of enzyme impairment among different tissues . CONCLUSIONS  The S135L mutation in the GALT gene is a prevalent cause of galactosemia among black patients . Because GALT activity varies in different tissues of patients homozygous for S135L , they may have a better clinical outcome than patients who are homozygous for Q188R when both are treated from infancy . . \n "}}

Mutations in the ATP7B gene lead to Wilson disease , a copper toxicity disorder characterized by dramatic build-up of intracellular hepatic copper with subsequent hepatic and neuro-logical abnormalities . Using homologous recombination to disrupt the normal translation of ATP7B , we have generated a strain of mice that are homozygous mutants ( null ) for the Wilson disease gene . The ATP7B null mice display a gradual accumulation of hepatic copper that increases to a level 60-fold greater than normal by 5 months of age . An increase in copper concentration was also observed in the kidney , brain , placenta and lactating mammary glands of homo-zygous mutants , although milk from the mutant glands was copper deficient . Morphological abnormalities resembling cirrhosis developed in the majority of the livers from homozygous mutants older than 7 months of age . Progeny of the homozygous mutant females demonstrated neurological abnormalities and growth retardation characteristic of copper deficiency . Copper concentration in the livers of the newborn homozygous null mutants was decreased dramatically . In summary , inactivation of the murine ATP7B gene produces a form of cirrhotic liver disease that resembles Wilson disease in humans and the toxic milk phenotype in the mouse . . \n "}}

We observed a consistent , although modest , reactivation of the FMR1 gene with 4-phenylbutyrate , sodium butyrate and trichostatin A , as shown by RT-PCR . However , we report that combining these drugs with 5-azadC results in a 2- to 5-fold increase in FMR1 mRNA levels obtained with 5-azadC alone , thus showing a marked synergistic effect of histone hyperacetylation and DNA demethylation in the reactivation of FMR1 full mutations . . \n "}}

The mutation was not observed in DNA from either of the clinically unaffected parents of the proband . Protein microsequencing demonstrated expression of the abnormal allele in cartilage .

Identification of each mutant gene provides valuable information as to the type of mutation that occurs spontaneously . We report here a newly identified HPRT mutation in a Japanese patient with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome . This gene , designated HPRT Tokyo , had a single nucleotide change from G to A , as identified by sequencing cDNA amplified by the polymerase chain reaction . Allele specific oligonucleotide hybridization analysis using amplified genomic DNA showed that the mutant gene was transmitted from the maternal germ line . This mutation would lead to an amino acid substitution of Asp for Gly at the amino acid position 140 located within the putative 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate ( PRPP ) binding region . Missense mutations in human HPRT deficient patients thus far reported tend to accumulate in this functionally active region . However , a comparison of the data suggested that both missense and synonymous mutations can occur at any coding sequence of the human germ line HPRT gene , but that a limited percentage of all the missense mutations cause disease . The probability that a mutation will cause disease tends to be higher when the missense mutation is within a functionally important sequence . . \n "}}

The classic form of ALD usually has onset in childhood ( childhood cerebral ALD ) , with rapid neurologic deterioration leading to a vegetative state . Adult-onset cerebral ALD also presents with rapidly progressive neurologic dysfunction . Milder phenotypes such as adrenomyeloneuropathy and Addison disease only also have been recognized . Despite discovery of the causative gene , a molecular basis for the diverse clinical presentations remains to be elucidated . OBJECTIVES  To conduct mutational analyses in 29 Japanese patients with ALD from 29 unrelated families , to obtain knowledge of the spectrum of mutations in this gene , and to study genotype-phenotype correlations in Japanese patients . METHODS  The 29 patients comprised 13 patients with childhood cerebral ALD , 11 patients with adult-onset cerebral ALD , and 5 patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy . We conducted detailed mutational analyses of 29 unrelated Japanese patients with ALD by genomic Southern blot analysis and direct nucleotide sequence analysis of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction products derived from total RNA that was extracted from cultured skin fibroblasts , lymphoblastoid cells , or peripheral blood leukocytes . RESULTS  Three patients with adult-onset cerebral ALD were identified as having large genomic rearrangements . The remaining 26 patients were identified as having 21 independent mutations , including 12 novel mutations resulting in small nucleotide alterations in the ALD gene . Eighteen ( 69 % ) of 26 mutations were missense mutations . Most missense mutations involved amino acids conserved in homologous gene products , including PMP70 , mALDRP , and Pxa1p . The AG dinucleotide deletion at position 1081-1082 , which has been reported previously to be the most common mutation in white patients ( 12 % -17 % ) , was also identified as the most common mutation in Japanese patients ( 12 % ) . All phenotypes were associated with mutations resulting in protein truncation or subtle amino acid changes . There were no differences in phenotypic expressions between missense mutations involving conserved amino acids and those involving nonconserved amino acids . CONCLUSIONS  There are no obvious correlations between the phenotypes of patients with ALD and their genotypes , suggesting that other genetic or environmental factors modify the phenotypic expressions of ALD . . \n "}}

Isolated peripheral blood cell types from the doubly heterozygous mother of the affected males seemingly failed to express the G-6-PD allele in cis position with the WAS allele while her cultured skin fibroblasts expressed both G-6-PD alleles . Additionally , a histogram analysis of platelet size revealed a single population of abnormally small platelets in the affected propositus , whereas the heterozygous mother had no appreciable small platelet subpopulation . In vitro culture of hemopoietic progenitor cells of the heterozygous mother showed that the majority of progenitor cells did not express the WAS allele . However , a small number of cells expressing the G-6-PD type linked with the WAS allele were detected . The proportion of the latter progenitors was significantly higher among more primitive progenitors ( those giving rise to later appearing colonies ) . This observation suggests that selection against cells expressing the Wiskott-Aldrich defect takes place in the hemopoietic system of the heterozygous female and offers a possible means of carrier detection in some women .

Several alleles for the CYP2C9 gene have been reported . Individuals homozygous for the Leu359 variant ( CYP2C9 * 3 ) have been shown to have significantly lower drug clearances compared with Ile359 ( CYP2C9 * 1 ) homozygous individuals . A male Caucasian who participated in six bioavailability studies in our laboratory over a period of several years showed extremely low clearance of two drugs  phenytoin and glipizide ( both substrates of CYP2C9 ) , but not for nifedipine ( a CYP3A4 substrate ) and chlorpheniramine ( a CYP2D6 substrate ) . His oral clearance of phenytoin was 21 % of the mean of the other 11 individuals participating in the study , and his oral clearance of glipizide , a second generation sulfonylurea structurally similar to tolbutamide , was only 188 % of the mean of the other 10 individuals . However , his oral clearance of nifedipine and chlorpheniramine did not differ from individuals in other studies performed at our laboratories . An additional blood sample was obtained from this individual to determine if he possessed any of the known CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 allelic variants that would account for his poor clearance of the CYP2C9 substrates ( phenytoin and glipizide ) compared with the CYP3A4 ( nifedipine ) and CYP2D6 ( chlorpheniramine ) substrates . The results of the genotype testing showed that this individual was homozygous for the CYP2C9 * 3 allele and did not possess any of the known defective CYP2C19 alleles . This study establishes that the Leu359 mutation is responsible for the phenytoin and glipizide / tolbutamide poor metabolizer phenotype . . \n "}}

This idea is based partly on the phenotype of homozygous Krox20 ( Egr2 ) knockout mice , which display hypomyelination of the PNS and a block of Schwann cells at an early stage of differentiation . Mutations in the human EGR2 gene have recently been associated with the inherited peripheral neuropathies Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1 , Dejerine-Sottas syndrome and congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy . Three of the four EGR2 mutations are dominant and occur within the zinc finger DNA-binding domain . The fourth mutation is recessive and affects the inhibitory domain ( R1 ) that binds the NAB transcriptional co-repressors . A combination of DNA-binding assays and transcriptional analysis was used to determine the functional consequences of these mutations . The zinc finger mutations affect DNA binding and the amount of residual binding directly correlates with disease severity . The R1 domain mutation prevents interaction of EGR2 with the NAB co-repressors and thereby increases transcriptional activity . These data provide insight into the possible disease mechanisms underlying EGR2 mutations and the reason for varying severity and differences in inheritance patterns . . \n "}}

Type 1 disease is panethnic but is more prevalent in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ( AJ ) descent . Of the causative GBA mutations , N370S is particularly frequent in the AJ population , ( q approximately . 03 ) , whereas the 84GG insertion ( q approximately . 003 ) occurs exclusively in the Ashkenazim . To investigate the genetic history of these mutations in the AJ population , short tandem repeat ( STR ) markers were used to map a 9 . 3-cM region containing the GBA locus and to genotype 261 AJ N370S chromosomes , 60 European non-Jewish N370S chromosomes , and 62 AJ 84GG chromosomes . A highly conserved haplotype at four markers flanking GBA ( PKLR , D1S1595 , D1S2721 , and D1S2777 ) was observed on both the AJ chromosomes and the non-Jewish N370S chromosomes , suggesting the occurrence of a founder common to both populations . Of note , the presence of different divergent haplotypes suggested the occurrence of de novo , recurrent N370S mutations . In contrast , a different conserved haplotype at these markers was identified on the 84GG chromosomes , which was unique to the AJ population . On the basis of the linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) delta values , the non-Jewish European N370S chromosomes had greater haplotype diversity and less LD at the markers flanking the conserved haplotype than did the AJ N370S chromosomes . This finding is consistent with the presence of the N370S mutation in the non-Jewish European population prior to the founding of the AJ population . Coalescence analyses for the N370S and 84GG mutations estimated similar coalescence times , of 48 and 55.5 generations ago , respectively . The results of these studies are consistent with a significant bottleneck occurring in the AJ population during the first millennium , when the population became established in Europe . \n "}}

However , there have also been cases with an intergenerational contraction of the repeat . We examined 1 , 489 DM parent-offspring pairs , of which 95 ( 6 . 4 % ) showed such contractions in peripheral blood leukocytes ( PBL ) . In 56 of the 95 pairs , clinical data allowed an analysis of their anticipation status . It is surprising that anticipation occurred in 27 ( 48 % ) of these 56 pairs , while none clearly showed a later onset of DM in the symptomatic offspring . The contraction occurred in 76 ( 10 % ) of 753 paternal transmissions and in 19 ( 3 % ) of 736 maternal transmissions . Anticipation was observed more frequently in maternal ( 85 % ) than in paternal ( 37 % ) transmissions ( P < . 001 ) . The parental repeat size correlated with the size of intergenerational contraction ( r2 = . 50 , P < < . 001 ) , and the slope of linear regression was steeper in paternal ( - . 62 ) than in maternal ( - . 30 ) transmissions ( P < < . 001 ) . Sixteen DM parents had multiple DM offspring with the CTG repeat contractions . This frequency was higher than the frequency expected from the probability of the repeat contractions ( 6 . 4 % ) and the size of DM sib population ( 1 . 54 DM offspring per DM parent , in 968 DM parents ) . We conclude that ( 1 ) intergenerational contractions of the CTG repeat in leukocyte DNA frequently accompanies apparent anticipation , especially when DM is maternally transmitted , and ( 2 ) the paternal origin of the repeat and the presence of the repeat contraction in a sibling increase the probability of the CTG repeat contraction \n "}}

Both the A-T phenotype and the similarity of the ATM protein to other DNA-damage sensors suggests a role for ATM in biochemical pathways involved in the recognition , signalling and repair of DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) . There are strong parallels between the pattern of radiosensitivity , chromosomal instability and cancer predisposition in A-T patients and that in patients with Nijmegen breakage syndrome ( NBS ) . The protein defective in NBS , nibrin ( encoded by NBS1 ) , forms a complex with MRE11 and RAD50 ( refs 1 , 2 ) . This complex localizes to DSBs within 30 minutes after cellular exposure to ionizing radiation ( IR ) and is observed in brightly staining nuclear foci after a longer period of time . The overlap between clinical and cellular phenotypes in A-T and NBS suggests that ATM and nibrin may function in the same biochemical pathway . Here we demonstrate that nibrin is phosphorylated within one hour of treatment of cells with IR . This response is abrogated in A-T cells that either do not express ATM protein or express near full-length mutant protein . We also show that ATM physically interacts with and phosphorylates nibrin on serine 343 both in vivo and in vitro . Phosphorylation of this site appears to be functionally important because mutated nibrin ( S343A ) does not completely complement radiosensitivity in NBS cells . ATM phosphorylation of nibrin does not affect nibrin-MRE11-RAD50 association as revealed by radiation-induced foci formation . Our data provide a biochemical explanation for the similarity in phenotype between A-T and NBS . . \n "}}

This constant introduction of new mutations would be expected to result in a heterogeneous collection of genetic lesions , some of which may be novel . As we report here , the mutations in the hprt gene of seven L-N patients , selected from an initial survey of 28 patients , have been characterized and all were found to be distinctly different , as predicted .

We now show that this dysmorphic C6 is bactericidally active and lacks an epitope that was mapped to the most carboxy-terminal part of C6 using C6 cDNA fragments expressed as fusion proteins in the pUEX expression system . We thus predicted that the abnormal C6 molecule might be carboxy-terminally truncated and sought a mutation in an area approximately 14 % from the carboxy-terminal end of the coding sequence . By sequencing PCR-amplified products from this region , we found , in three individuals from two families , a mutation that might plausibly be responsible for the defect . All three have an abnormal 5 splice donor site of intron 15 , which would probably prevent splicing . An in-frame stop codon is found 17 codons downstream from the intron boundary , which would lead to a truncated polypeptide 13 . 5 % smaller than normal C6 .

A correlation has been demonstrated between the increase in the repeat number of this sequence and the severity of the disease . However , the clinical status of patients cannot be unambiguously ascertained solely on the basis of the number of CTG repeats . Moreover , the exclusive maternal inheritance of the congenital form remains unexplained . Our observation of differently sized repeats in various DM tissues from the same individual may explain why the size of the mutation observed in lymphocytes does not necessarily correlate with the severity and nature of symptoms . Through a molecular and genetic study of 142 families including 418 DM patients , we have investigated the dynamics of the CTG repeat meiotic instability . A positive correlation between the size of the repeat and the intergenerational enlargement was observed similarly through male and female meioses for  or = 1 . 5-kb fragments . This implies a size- and sex-dependent meiotic instability . Moreover , segregation analysis supports the hypothesis of a maternal as well as a familial predisposition for the occurrence of the congenital form .

Three other peroxisomal ABC transporters currently are known  adrenoleukodystrophy-related protein ( ALDRP ) , 70 kDa peroxisomal membrane protein ( PMP70 ) and PMP70- related protein . By using transient and stable overexpression of human cDNAs encoding ALDP and its closest relative ALDRP , we could restore the impaired peroxisomal beta-oxidation in fibroblasts of X-ALD patients . The pathognomonic accumulation of very long chain fatty acids could also be prevented by overexpression of ALDRP in immortalized X-ALD cells . Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that the functional replacement of ALDP by ALDRP was not due to stabilization of the mutated ALDP itself . Moreover , we were able to restore the peroxisomal beta-oxidation defect in the liver of ALDP-deficient mice by stimulation of ALDRP and PMP70 gene expression through a dietary treatment with the peroxisome proliferator fenofibrate .

Approximately 50-60 mutations have been reported in Caucasians and are reflected in a wide range of clinical severities . Most mutations are linked to specific haplotypes , as defined by eight polymorphic restriction sites in the PAH gene . We hypothesized that there is at least one mild mutation linked to haplotype 12 in the Swedish PKU / HPA population , since 7 of 8 patients carrying haplotype 12 had mild HPA . Sequence analysis revealed a C-to-G transversion at the second base of codon 322 , resulting in a substitution of glycine for alanine , in four mutant haplotype 12 genes , and a G-to-A transition at the second base of codon 408 , resulting in a substitution of glutamine for arginine , in another three mutant haplotype 12 genes . These mutations segregated with mutant haplotype 12 alleles in nuclear families but were not present on normal or other mutant alleles . Both mutations were tested in a eukaryotic expression system in which enzyme activities of different mutant PAH enzymes reflect the relative severities of the mutations , although these in vitro activities cannot be translated directly into in vivo hepatic activities . The A322G mutant PAH had about 75 % and the R408Q mutant PAH about 55 % of the wild-type PAH enzyme activity . These in vitro activities are the highest reported for mutant PAH enzymes produced in the same expression system . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) . \n "}}

Although both PLS and HMS share the cardinal features of PPK and severe periodontitis , a number of additional findings are reported in HMS including arachnodactyly , acro-osteolysis , atrophic changes of the nails , and a radiographic deformity of the fingers . While PLS cases have been identified throughout the world , HMS has only been described among descendants of a religious isolate originally from Cochin , India . Parental consanguinity is a characteristic of many cases of both conditions . Although autosomal recessive transmission of PLS is evident , a more \" complex \" autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance with phenotypic influences from a closely linked modifying locus has been hypothesised for HMS . Recently , mutations of the cathepsin C gene have been identified as the underlying genetic defect in PLS . To determine if a cathepsin C mutation is also responsible for HMS , we sequenced the gene in affected and unaffected subjects from the Cochin isolate in which both the PLS and HMS phenotypes appear . Here we report identification of a mutation of cathepsin C ( exon 6 , 2127A-- > G ) that changes a highly conserved amino acid in the cathepsin C peptide . This mutation segregates with HMS in four nuclear families . Additionally , the existence of a shared common haplotype for genetic loci flanking the cathepsin C gene suggests that affected subjects descended from the Cochin isolate are homozygous for a mutation inherited \" identical by descent \" from a common ancestor . This finding supports simple autosomal recessive inheritance for HMS in these families . We also report a mutation of the same exon 6 CTSC codon ( 2126C-- > T ) in a Turkish family with classical PLS . These findings provide evidence that PLS and HMS are allelic variants of cathepsin C gene mutations . . \n "}}

This mutation is the result of an internal duplication of 16-20 kilobases of the gene . The structure of the mutant gene suggests that the duplication was not generated by a single unequal crossing-over event between two normal HPRT alleles . Growth of Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblasts from this patient in selective medium has permitted isolation of spontaneous HPRT + revertants of this mutation . The reversion event involves a second major HPRT gene rearrangement where most or all of the duplicated portion of the mutant gene is deleted . The original mutation therefore has the potential for spontaneous somatic reversion . This may explain the relatively mild symptoms of the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome exhibited by this patient . . \n "}}

Crossovers with the VHL locus suggest that the defect responsible for the VHL phenotype is not a mutation in the RAF1 gene itself .

Sporadic renal cell carcinomas have previously been associated with the loss of regions on chromosome 3p ( refs 5 , 6 ) .

In the current study , we determined the frequency of this new mutation in Japanese hyperalphalipoproteinemic ( HDL-cholesterol > or = 100 mg / dl ) subjects . A rapid and easy screening method for this new mutation was developed using a polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) -mediated site-directed mutagenesis . Among 117 Japanese hyperalphalipoproteinemic subjects ( HDL-cholesterol ; 116 . 7 + / - 16 . 5 mg / dl , mean + / - S . D . ) without the intron 14 splice defect , three homozygotes ( 2 . 5 % ) and 34 heterozygotes ( 29 . 1 % ) were found to have the 442D  G mutation . The relative allelic frequency of this mutation was calculated to be 0 . 17 . One of the homozygotes for the 442D  G mutation was the patient previously described by us as having hyperalphalipoproteinemia with corneal opacity and coronary heart disease . This was the first reported subject homozygous for the CETP deficiency who also demonstrated atherosclerotic symptoms . In homozygous subjects , CETP activity ranged from 37 % to 62 % of the normal value , which was consistent with the results obtained from the transient expression experiment previously reported ; however , the specific activity of CETP was not as low as expected .

In many parts of the world the Mediterranean type of G6PD deficiency is prevalent .

A C----T mutation at nucleotide 563 of G6PD Mediterranean has been identified by Vulliamy et al . , and the same mutation has been found by De Vita et al . in G6PD Mediterranean , G6PD Sassari , and G6PD Cagliari . The latter subjects had an additional mutation , at nucleotide 1311 , that did not produce a coding change . We have examined genomic DNA of five patients--four of Spanish origin and one of Jewish origin--having enzymatically documented G6PD Mediterranean . All had both the mutation at nucleotide 563 and that at nucleotide 1311 . A sixth sample , resembling G6PD Mediterranean kinetically but with a slightly rapid electrophoretic mobility , was designated G6PD Andalus and was found to have a different mutation , a G----A transition at nucleotide 1361 , producing an arginine-to-histidine substitution . These studies suggest that G6PD Mediterranean is , after all , relatively homogeneous .\n "}}

Patients with FAP typically develop hundreds to thousands of benign colorectal tumors and early-onset colorectal cancer . A subset of germline APC mutations results in an attenuated FAP ( AFAP ) phenotype , in which patients develop fewer tumors and develop them at an older age . Although a genotype-phenotype correlation between the locations of APC germline mutations and the development of AFAP has been well documented , the mechanism for AFAP has not been well defined . We investigated the mechanism for AFAP in patients carrying a mutant APC allele ( APC ( AS9 ) ) that has a mutation in the alternatively spliced region of exon 9 . APC ( AS9 ) was found to down-regulate beta-catenin-regulated transcription , the major tumor-suppressor function of APC , as did the wild-type APC . Mutation analysis showed that both APC ( AS9 ) and the wild-type APC alleles were somatically mutated in most colorectal tumors from these patients . Functional analysis showed that 4666insA , a common somatic mutation in APC ( AS9 ) in these tumors , did not inactivate the wild-type APC . Our results indicate that carriers of APC ( AS9 ) develop fewer colorectal tumors than do typical patients with FAP because somatic inactivation of both APC alleles is necessary for colorectal tumorigenesis .

To date we have identified 65 missense mutations in the GALNS gene from MPS IVA patients , but the correlation between genotype and phenotype has remained unclear . We studied 17 missense mutations using biochemical approaches and 32 missense mutations , using structural analyses . Fifteen missense mutations and two newly engineered active site mutations ( C79S , C79T ) were characterized by transient expression analysis . Mutant proteins , except for C79S and C79T , were destabilized and detected as insoluble precursor forms while the C79S and C79T mutants were of a soluble mature size . Mutants found in the severe phenotype had no activity . Mutants found in the mild phenotype had a considerable residual activity ( 1 . 3-13 . 3 % of wild-type GALNS activity ) . Sulfatases , including GALNS , are members of a highly conserved gene family sharing an extensive sequence homology . Thus , a tertiary structural model of human GALNS was constructed from the X-ray crystal structure of N -acetylgalacto-samine-4-sulfatase and arylsulfatase A , using homology modeling , and 32 missense mutations were investigated . Consequently , we propose that there are at least three different reasons for the severe phenotype  ( i ) destruction of the hydrophobic core or modification of the packing ; ( ii ) removal of a salt bridge to destabilize the entire conformation ; ( iii ) modification of the active site . In contrast , mild mutations were mostly located on the surface of the GALNS protein . These studies shed further light on the genotype-phenotype correlation of MPS IVA and structure-function relationship in the sulfatase family .\n "}}

The proband was a female patient with low levels of factor VIII activity . Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) amplification and DNA sequencing were employed to examine exons encoding the putative factor VIII binding domain of vWF .

Recombinant vWF containing the observed amino acid substitution was expressed in COS-1 cells . The mutant vWF was processed and secreted normally , and was functionally equivalent to wild-type vWF in its ability to bind to platelets .

Subsequent reports in additional collections of families have yielded conflicting results . In addition , evidence for locus heterogeneity has been provided by the identification of other putative hereditary prostate cancer loci on Xq27-28 , 1q42-43 , and 1p36 . The present study describes a combined analysis for six markers in the 1q24-25 region in 772 families affected by hereditary prostate cancer and ascertained by the members of the International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics ( ICPCG ) from North America , Australia , Finland , Norway , Sweden , and the United Kingdom . Overall , there was some evidence for linkage , with a peak parametric multipoint LOD score assuming heterogeneity ( HLOD ) of 1 . 40 ( P = . 01 ) at D1S212 . The estimated proportion of families ( alpha ) linked to the locus was . 06 ( 1-LOD support interval . 01- . 12 ) . This evidence was not observed by a nonparametric approach , presumably because of the extensive heterogeneity . Further parametric analysis revealed a significant effect of the presence of male-to-male disease transmission within the families . In the subset of 491 such families , the peak HLOD was 2 . In the subset of 491 such families , the peak HLOD was 2 . 56 ( P = . 0006 ) and alpha = . 11 ( 1-LOD support interval . 04- . 19 ) , compared with HLODs of 0 in the remaining 281 families .

The gene for EDMD on Xq28 encodes a novel protein named emerin that localizes at the nuclear membrane of skeletal , cardiac and smooth muscles and some other non-muscle tissues .

Because of the high frequency of these particular haplotypes in Bulgaria , Italy , and Turkey , it appears to be one of the more frequent defects in the PAH gene causing classical phenylketonuria in this part of Europe . The mutation is a G to A transition at position 546 in intron 10 of the PAH gene , 11 bp upstream from the intron 10 / exon 11 boundary . It activates a cryptic splice site and results in an in-frame insertion of 9 nucleotides between exon 10 and exon 11 of the processed mRNA . Normal amounts of liver PAH protein are present in homozygous patients , but no catalytic activity can be detected . This loss of enzyme activity is probably caused by conformational changes resulting from the insertion of three additional amino acids ( Gly-Leu-Gln ) between the normal sequences encoded by exon 10 and exon 11 . . \n "}}

The Sit ( a ) alloantigen is of low frequency ( 1 / 400 ) in the German population . Immunochemical studies demonstrated that the Sit ( a ) epitopes reside on platelet glycoprotein ( GP ) Ia . Nucleotide sequence analysis of GPIa cDNA derived from Sit ( a ) -positive platelets showed C ( 2531 ) -- > T ( 2531 ) point mutation , resulting in Thr ( 799 ) Met dimorphism . Analysis of genomic DNA from 22 Sit ( a ) -negative normal individuals showed that the Thr ( 799 ) is encoded by ACG ( 2532 ) ( 90 . 9 % ) or ACA ( 2532 ) ( 9 . 1 % ) . To establish a DNA typing technique , we elucidated the organization of the GPIa gene adjacent to the polymorphic bases . The introns ( 421 bp and 1 . 2 kb ) encompass a 142-bp exon with the 2 polymorphic bases 2531 and 2532 . Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis on DNA derived from 100 donors using the restriction enzyme Mae III showed that the Met ( 799 ) form of GPIa is restricted to Sit ( a ) ( + ) phenotype . Analysis of stable Chinese hamster ovary transfectants expressing allele-specific recombinant forms of GPIa showed that anti-Sit ( a ) exclusively reacted with the Glu ( 505 ) Met ( 799 ) , but not with the Glu ( 505 ) Thr ( 799 ) and the Lys ( 505 ) Thr ( 799 ) isoforms . In contrast , anti-Br ( a ) ( HPA-5b ) only recognized the Lys ( 505 ) Thr ( 799 ) form , whereas anti-Br ( b ) ( HPA-5a ) reacted with both Glu ( 505 ) Thr ( 799 ) and Glu ( 505 ) Met ( 799 ) isoforms . These results demonstrated that the Met ( 799 ) is responsible for formation of the Sit ( a ) alloantigenic determinants , whereas amino acid 505 ( Lys or Glu ) specifically controls the expression of Br ( a ) and Br ( b ) epitopes , respectively . Platelet aggregation responses of Sit ( a ) ( + ) individuals were diminished in response to collagen , indicating that the Thr ( 799 ) Met mutation affects the function of the GPIa / IIa complex \n "}}

This results in the fusion of PAX3 , a developmental transcription factor required for limb myogenesis , with FKHR , a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors . The resultant PAX3-FKHR gene possesses transforming properties ; however , the effects of this chimeric oncogene on gene expression are largely unknown . To investigate the actions of these transcription factors , both Pax3 and PAX3-FKHR were introduced into NIH 3T3 cells , and the resultant gene expression changes were analyzed with a murine cDNA microarray containing 2 , 225 elements . We found that PAX3-FKHR but not PAX3 activated a myogenic transcription program including the induction of transcription factors MyoD , Myogenin , Six1 , and Slug as well as a battery of genes involved in several aspects of muscle function . Notable among this group were the growth factor gene Igf2 and its binding protein Igfbp5 . Relevance of this model was suggested by verification that three of these genes ( IGFBP5 , HSIX1 , and Slug ) were also expressed in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines . This study utilizes cDNA microarrays to elucidate the pattern of gene expression induced by an oncogenic transcription factor and demonstrates the profound myogenic properties of PAX3-FKHR in NIH 3T3 cells . . \n "}}

This disorder was mapped to chromosome 7 and the gene causing Pendred syndrome ( PDS ) was subsequently identified by positional cloning . PDS encodes a putative transmembrane protein designated pendrin . Pendrin is closely related to a family of sulfate transport proteins that includes the rat sulfate-anion transporter ( encoded by Sat-1 ; 29 % amino acid sequence identity ) , the human diastrophic dysplasia sulfate transporter ( encoded by DTD ; 32 % ) and the human sulfate transporter downregulated in adenoma ( encoded by DRA ; 45 % ) . On the basis of this homology and the presence of a slightly modified sulfate-transporter signature sequence comprising its putative second transmembrane domain , pendrin has been proposed to function as a sulfate transporter . We were unable to detect evidence of sulfate transport following the expression of pendrin in Xenopus laevis oocytes by microinjection of PDS cRNA or in Sf9 cells following infection with PDS-recombinant baculovirus . The rates of transport for iodide and chloride were significantly increased following the expression of pendrin in both cell systems .

A screen of human tissues with this antibody reveals retinoschisin to be retina specific and the antibody detects a protein of similar size in bovine and murine retinae . We investigated the expression pattern in the retina of both RS1 mRNA ( using in situ hybridization with riboprobes ) and retinoschisin ( using immunohistochemistry ) . The antisense riboprobe detected RS1 mRNA only in the photoreceptor layer but the protein product of the gene was present both in the photoreceptors and within the inner portions of the retina .

Therefore , HFE appears to reduce cellular acquisition of iron from Tf within endocytic compartments . HFE specifically reduces iron uptake from Tf , as non-Tf-mediated iron uptake from Fe-nitrilotriacetic acid is not altered . These results explain the decreased ferritin levels seen in our HeLa cell system and demonstrate the specific control of HFE over the Tf-mediated pathway of iron uptake .

In a Turkish family with the diagnosis of Li-Fraumeni syndrome , we analyzed the mutation pattern of TP53 , P57KIP2 , P15INK4B , and P16INK4A in the peripheral blood , and loss of heterozygosity ( homo / hemizygous deletion ) pattern of TP53 and P15INK4B / P16INK4A in two tumor tissues . The propositus had a seminoma , his daughter a medulloblastoma , and one of his healthy cousins , a TP53 codon 292 missense point mutation ( AAA-- > ATA ; Lys-- > Ile ) in the peripheral blood cells . Tumor tissue obtained from the propositus with the seminoma revealed loss of heterozygosity in the TP53 gene . In the analyses of tumor tissues from the propositus and his daughter , a P16INK4A codon 94 missense point mutation ( GCG-- > GAG ; Ala-- > Glu ) was observed with the hereditary TP53 mutation . P16INK4A codon 94 mutation observed in our family is a novel mutation in Li-Fraumeni syndrome . No other gene alteration in TP53 , P57KIP2 , P15INK4B , and P16INK4A was observed . Existence of the P16INK4A mutation and the hereditary TP53 mutation with or without loss of heterozygosity in the TP53 gene ( seminoma / medulloblastoma ) may be evidence for a common mechanism involved in tumorogenesis . The gene alterations in TP53 and P16INK4A genes may be used as tumor markers in our family . . \n "}}

We used polyclonal and monoclonal anti-fusion protein antibodies to identify native huntingtin in rat , monkey , and human . Western blots revealed a protein with the expected molecular weight which is present in the soluble fraction of rat and monkey brain tissues and lymphoblastoid cells from control cases . In lymphoblastoid cell lines from juvenile-onset heterozygote HD cases , both normal and mutant huntingtin are expressed , and increasing repeat expansion leads to lower levels of the mutant protein . Immunocytochemistry indicates that huntingtin is located in neurons throughout the brain , with the highest levels evident in larger neurons . In the human striatum , huntingtin is enriched in a patch-like distribution , potentially corresponding to the first areas affected in HD . Subcellular localization of huntingtin is consistent with a cytosolic protein primarily found in somatodendritic regions . Huntingtin appears to particularly associate with microtubules , although some is also associated with synaptic vesicles . On the basis of the localization of huntingtin in association with microtubules , we speculate that the mutation impairs the cytoskeletal anchoring or transport of mitochondria , vesicles , or other organelles or molecules . . \n "}}

The disorder exhibits considerable allelic heterogeneity and , at the end of 1998 , more than 150 different base changes were recorded in 24 different populations and ethnic groups in 15 countries worldwide . The mutations most frequently cited are Q188R , K285N , S135L , and N314D . Q188R is the most common mutation in European populations or in those predominantly of European descent . Overall , it accounts for 60-70 % of mutant chromosomes , but there are significant differences in its relative frequency in individual populations . Individuals homoallelic for Q188R tend to have a severe phenotype and this is in keeping with the virtually complete loss of enzyme activity observed in in vitro expression systems . Globally , K285N is rarer , but in many European populations it can be found on 25-40 % of mutant chromosomes . It is invariably associated with a severe phenotype . S135L is found almost exclusively in African Americans . In vitro expression results are discrepant , but some individuals carrying S135L appear to exhibit GALT activity in some tissues . Duarte 1 ( or Los Angeles ) and Duarte 2 ( or Duarte ) variants carry the same amino acid substitution , N314D , even though D1 is associated with increased erythrocyte GALT activity and D2 with reduced activity . N314D is in linkage disequilibrium with other base changes that differ on the D1 and D2 alleles . N314D does not impair GALT activity in in vitro expression systems . However , there are differences in the abundance of GALT protein in lymphoblastoid cells lines from D2 and D1 individuals . It is unclear whether the specific molecular changes that distinguish the D1 and D2 alleles account for the different activities . The considerable genetic heterogeneity documented to date undoubtedly contributes to the phenotypic heterogeneity that is observed in galactosemia . The additional effects of nonallelic variation and other constitutional factors on phenotypic variability remain to be elucidated . . \n "}}

Yeast knockout models , and histological and biochemical data from patient heart biopsies or autopsies indicate that the frataxin defect causes a specific iron-sulfur protein deficiency and mitochondrial iron accumulation leading to the pathological changes . Affected human tissues are rarely available to further examine this hypothesis . To study the mechanism of the disease , we generated a mouse model by deletion of exon 4 leading to inactivation of the Frda gene product .

In order to map these markers with respect to the FRDA locus , all within a 1-cM confidence interval , we sought to increase the genetic information of available FRDA families by considering homozygosity by descent and association with founder haplotypes in isolated populations . This approach allowed us to identify one phase-known recombination and one probable historic recombination on haplotypes from Reunion Island patients , both of which place three of the five markers proximal to FRDA .

WASP contains several functional domains through which it interacts with proteins involved in intracellular signaling and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton . In this report , 17 WASP gene mutations were identified , 12 of which are novel . DNA of affected males and obligate carriers was PCR amplified and analyzed by SSCA , heteroduplex analysis , and direct sequencing . The effects of the mutations at the mRNA and protein level were ascertained by RT-PCR and Western blot analyses . All missense mutations were located in exons 1-4 . Most of the nonsense , frameshift and splice site mutations were found in exons 6-11 . Mutations that alter splice sites led to the synthesis of several types of mRNAs , a fraction of which represented the normally spliced product . The presence of normally spliced transcripts was correlated with a milder phenotype . When one such case was studied by Western blotting , reduced amounts of normal-size WASP were present . In other cases as well , a correlation was found between the amount of normal or mutant WASP present and the phenotypes of the affected individuals . No protein was detected in two individuals with severe WAS . Reduced levels of a normal-size WASP with a missense mutation were seen in two individuals with XLT . It is concluded that mutation analysis at the DNA level is not sufficient for predicting clinical course . Studies at the transcript and protein level are needed for a better assessment . . \n "}}

Hemolytic complement and bacteriolytic activity could be restored by the addition of purified C5 . No chemotactic activity for polymorphonuclear leukocytes could be generated in the C5-deficient serums upon activation of either the classic or alternative pathways , again demonstrating the importance of C5 in human subjects for the production of chemotactic factors .

One of the target genes for beta-catenin / TCF encodes c-MYC , explaining why constitutive activation of the WNT pathway can lead to cancer , particularly in the colon . Most colon cancers arise from mutations in the gene encoding adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) , a protein required for ubiquitin-mediated degradation of beta-catenin , but a small percentage of colon and some other cancers harbour beta-catenin-stabilizing mutations . Recently , we discovered that transgenic mice expressing an activated beta-catenin are predisposed to developing skin tumours resembling pilomatricomas . Given that the skin of these adult mice also exhibits signs of de novo hair-follicle morphogenesis , we wondered whether human pilomatricomas might originate from hair matrix cells and whether they might possess beta-catenin-stabilizing mutations . Here , we explore the cell origin and aetiology of this common human skin tumour . We found nuclear LEF-1 in the dividing tumour cells , providing biochemical evidence that pilomatricomas are derived from hair matrix cells . At least 75 % of these tumours possess mutations affecting the amino-terminal segment , normally involved in phosphorylation-dependent , ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the protein . This percentage of CTNNB1 mutations is greater than in all other human tumours examined thus far , and directly implicates beta-catenin / LEF misregulation as the major cause of hair matrix cell tumorigenesis in humans . . \n "}}

Our results are compatible with this hypothesis in that the PKU mutation might have occurred in northern Mongoloids and subsequently spread to the Chinese and Japanese populations .\n "}}

The data place TCD distal to PGK and DXS72 , very close to DXYS1 and DXYS5 ( Zmax = 24 at theta = 0 ) and proximal to DXYS4 and DXYS12 . This agrees with the data obtained from other linkage studies and from physical mapping . All the TCD males and carrier females studied have the same DXYS1 allele in coupling with TCD . In Northeastern Finland , 66 / 69 chromosomes carrying TCD had the same haplotype at loci DXS72 , DXYS1 , DXYS4 , and DXYS12 . The same haplotype is seen in only 15 / 99 chromosomes not carrying TCD . Moreover , in 71 / 104 non-TCD chromosomes , the haplotype at six marker loci is different from those seen in any of the 76 TCD chromosomes . This supports the previously described hypothesis that the large Northern Finnish choroideremia pedigrees , comprising a total of over 80 living patients representing more than a fifth of all TCD patients described worldwide , carry the same mutation .

The authors earlier findings of a negative electroretinogram ( ERG ) in a boy with Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) led them to investigate dystrophin gene deletions and ERGs in five boys with DMD . The authors wanted to determined whether there were similar ERG findings in an animal model for DMD , the mdx mouse . METHODS . Ganzfeld ERGs were recorded in five boys with DMD after a complete ophthalmic examination . The dystrophin gene was analyzed by Southern blot hybridization . ERGs were recorded in anesthetized mdx and control mice with a modified Grass photostimulator ( Grass Instrument Company , Quincy , MA ) . RESULTS . Ophthalmic examinations in all five boys had normal findings , yet an abnormal negative ERG was recorded for each subject . The subjects gene deletions were variable , ranging from large deletions to no detectable deletions . The ERGs of the mdx mice were normal and did not differ significantly from those of the control mice . CONCLUSIONS . The authors believe the unique ERG recorded for the human subjects is a manifestation of DMD associated with defects at the dystrophin gene locus and represents a new clinical entity . The ERG of the mdx mouse may be spared for several reasons , including milder effects of the mouse gene defect , differences in muscle and retinal gene product , or species differences in the biochemical role of dystrophin . The ERG shows promise of becoming a noninvasive diagnostic tool for DMD and its milder allelic forms . . \n "}}

METHODOLOGY  PAH gene mutations were examined in 222 hyperphenylalaninemic females enrolled in the Maternal PKU Collaborative Study ( MPKUCS ) . A total of 84 different mutations were detected , and complete genotype was obtained in 199 individuals . Based on previous knowledge about mutation-phenotype associations , 78 of the mutations could be assigned to one of four classes of severity ( severe PKU , moderate PKU , mild PKU , and mild hyperphenylalaninemia [ MHP ] ) . Then , 189 MPKUCS subjects were grouped according to the various combinations of mutation classifications . The sample sizes were large enough for statistical testing in four groups with at least one mutation that completely abolishes enzyme activity . These patients are considered functionally hemizygous . RESULTS  The biochemical phenotype predicted from the genotype in functionally hemizygous patients was related significantly to the assigned phenylalanine level . Cognitive performance ( IQ ) was also significantly related to genotype . The IQ of PAH-deficient mothers with a severe PKU mutation in combination with a MHP mutation or a mild PKU mutation was 99 and 96 , respectively , whereas the IQ of PKU mothers with two severe PKU mutations or with one severe and one moderate PKU mutation was 83 and 84 , respectively . Of the patients with PKU , 92 % had been treated during childhood . Those who were untreated or treated late had lower than average IQ scores for their group of mutation combinations . Females with moderate or mild PKU who were treated early and treated for > 6 years showed IQ scores 10 points above average for their group . CONCLUSIONS  The reproductive outcome in maternal phenylketonuria is dependent on prenatal metabolic control and postnatal environmental circumstances . Both factors depend on the intellectual resources of the mother with PKU . The significant relationship among genotype , biochemical phenotype , and cognitive performance observed in the present study is of importance for the development of an optimal strategy for future treatment of females with PKU who plan pregnancy . . \n "}}

The recent isolation of the responsible gene ( adenomatous polyposis coli or APC ) has facilitated the search for germ line mutations in affected individuals . Previous authors have used the RNase protection assay and the single-strand conformation polymorphisms procedure to screen for mutations . In this study we used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis ( DGGE ) . DGGE analysis of 10 APC exons ( 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 12 , 13 , 14 , and part of 15 ) in 33 unrelated Dutch FAP patients has led to the identification of eight novel germ line mutations resulting in stop codons or frameshifts .

An extension of the DGGE analysis to the entire coding region in a sufficient number of clinically well-characterized , unrelated patients will facilitate the establishment of genotype-phenotype correlations . On the other hand , the occurrence of an extremely heterogeneous spectrum of mutations spread throughout the entire length of the large APC gene among the FAP patients indicates that this approach may not be useful as a rapid presymptomatic diagnostic procedure in a routine laboratory . Nevertheless , the above DGGE approach has incidentally led to the identification of a common polymorphism in exon 13 . Such intragenic polymorphisms offer a practical approach to a more rapid procedure for presymptomatic diagnosis of FAP by linkage analysis in informative families . . \n "}}

Inherited mutations in the BRCA1 gene are associated with a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer in some families . However , little is known about the contribution of BRCA1 mutations to breast cancer in the general population . We analyzed DNA samples from women enrolled in a population-based study of early-onset breast cancer to assess the spectrum and frequency of germ-line BRCA1 mutations in young women with breast cancer . METHODS . We studied 80 women in whom breast cancer was diagnosed before the age of 35 , and who were not selected on the basis of family history . Genomic DNA was studied for BRCA1 mutations by analysis involving single-strand conformation polymorphisms and with allele-specific assays . Alterations were defined by DNA sequencing . RESULTS . Germ-line BRCA1 mutations were identified in 6 of the 80 women . Four additional rare sequence variants of unknown functional importance were also identified . Two of the mutations and three of the rare sequence variants were found among the 39 women who reported no family history of breast or ovarian cancer . None of the mutations and only one of the rare variants was identified in a reference population of 73 unrelated subjects . CONCLUSIONS . Alterations in BRCA1 were identified in approximately 10 percent of this cohort of young women with breast cancer . The risk of harboring a mutation was not limited to women with family histories of breast or ovarian cancer . These results represent a minimal estimate of the frequency of BRCA1 mutations in this population . Comprehensive methods of identifying BRCA1 mutations and understanding their importance will be needed before testing of women in the general population can be undertaken . . \n "}}

An auxiliary beta ( 1 ) -subunit , widely expressed in excitable tissues , shifts the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation toward more negative potentials and restores normal gating kinetics of brain and skeletal muscle Na ( + ) channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes but has little if any functional effect on the cardiac isoform . Here , we characterize the altered effects of a human beta ( 1 ) -subunit ( hbeta ( 1 ) ) on the heterologously expressed hH1 mutation ( T1620M ) previously associated with IVF . METHODS AND RESULTS  When expressed alone in Xenopus oocytes , T1620M exhibited no persistent currents , in contrast to the LQT3 mutant channels , but the midpoint of steady-state inactivation ( V ( 1 / 2 ) ) was significantly shifted toward more positive potentials than for wild-type hH1 . Coexpression of hbeta ( 1 ) did not significantly alter current decay or recovery from inactivation of wild-type hH1 ; however , it further shifted the V ( 1 / 2 ) and accelerated the recovery from inactivation of T1620M . Oocyte macropatch analysis revealed that the activation kinetics of T1620M were normal . CONCLUSIONS  It is suggested that coexpression of hbeta ( 1 ) exposes a more severe functional defect that results in a greater overlap in the relationship between channel inactivation and activation ( window current ) in T1620M , which is proposed to be a potential pathophysiological mechanism of IVF in vivo . One possible explanation for our finding is an altered alpha- / beta ( 1 ) -subunit association in the mutant . . \n "}}

Truncating germline and somatic mutations ( or , infrequently , allelic loss ) occur in tumors in FAP ( familial adenomatous polyposis ) . Most sporadic colorectal cancers also have two APC mutations . Clues from attenuated polyposis , missense germline variants with mild disease and the somatic mutation cluster region ( codons 1 , 250-1 , 450 ) indicate , however , that APC mutations might not result in simple loss of protein function . We have found that FAP patients with germline APC mutations within a small region ( codons 1 , 194-1 , 392 at most ) mainly show allelic loss in their colorectal adenomas , in contrast to other FAP patients , whose second hits tend to occur by truncating mutations in the mutation cluster region . Our results indicate that different APC mutations provide cells with different selective advantages , with mutations close to codon 1 , 300 providing the greatest advantage .

Genetic analyses of Japanese C9 deficiency have shown that a C-to-T transition leading to TGA stop codon for Arg95 in exon 4 of the C9 gene ( Arg95Stop ) is common in Japanese C9 deficiency . To determine the prevalence of heterozygous carriers of the Arg95Stop mutation in a Japanese population , we collected DNA samples from 300 individuals in two of the four main islands of Japan . Heterozygote detection was performed with an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) system designed to detect exclusively only one of the normal and mutant alleles , followed by confirmation with PCR / single-strand conformation polymorphism ( SSCP ) analysis and direct sequencing . Twenty individuals were heterozygous for the Arg95Stop mutation . None was homozygous . The prevalence of carriers of the Arg95Stop mutation was 6 . 7 % ( 20 / 300 ) .

We determined the ( CTG ) n repeat lengths in a broad range of tissue DNAs from patients with mild , classical , or congenital manifestation of DM . Differences in the repeat length were seen in somatic tissues from single DM individuals and twins . Repeats appeared to expand to a similar extent in tissues originating from the same embryonal origin . In most male patients carrying intermediate- or small-sized expansions in blood , the repeat lengths covered a markedly wider range in sperm . In contrast , male patients with large allele expansions in blood ( > 700 CTGs ) had similar or smaller repeats in sperm , when detectable . Sperm alleles with > 1 , 000 CTGs were not seen . We conclude that DM patients can be considered gonosomal mosaics , i . e e . , combined somatic and germ-line tissue mosaics . Most remarkably , we observed multiple cases where the length distributions of intermediate- or small-sized alleles in fathers sperm were significantly different from that in their offsprings blood . Our combined findings indicate that intergenerational length changes in the unstable CTG repeat are most likely to occur during early embryonic mitotic divisions in both somatic and germ-line tissue formation . Both the initial CTG length , the overall number of cell divisions involved in tissue formation , and perhaps a specific selection process in spermatogenesis may influence the dynamics of this process .

Activation relieves an autoinhibitory contact between the GTPase-binding domain and the carboxy-terminal region of WASP proteins . Here we report the autoinhibited structure of the GTPase-binding domain of WASP , which can be induced by the C-terminal region or by organic co-solvents . In the autoinhibited complex , intramolecular interactions with the GTPase-binding domain occlude residues of the C terminus that regulate the Arp2 / 3 actin-nucleating complex . Binding of Cdc42 to the GTPase-binding domain causes a dramatic conformational change , resulting in disruption of the hydrophobic core and release of the C terminus , enabling its interaction with the actin regulatory machinery . These data show that intrinsically unstructured peptides such as the GTPase-binding domain of WASP can be induced into distinct structural and functional states depending on context . . \n "}}

The molecular basis of this disorder is at present not well understood . We report here two missense mutations which result in low or undetectable enzymatic activity . First , we identified at nucleotide 591 a transition which substitutes glutamine 188 by arginine . The mutated glutamine is not only highly conserved in evolution ( conserved also in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) , but is also two amino acid residues downstream from the active site histidine-proline-histidine triad and results in about 10 % of normal enzymatic activity . The arginine 188 mutation is the most common galactosemia mutation characterized to date . It accounts for one-fourth of the galactosemia alleles studied . Second , we report the substitution of arginine 333 by tryptophan , caused by a transition at nucleotide 1025 . The area surrounding this missense mutation is the most highly conserved domain in the homologous enzymes from E . coli , yeast , and humans , and this mutation results in undetectable enzymatic activity , suggesting that this is a severe mutation .

It has been particularly difficult to rationalize the dominant inheritance with the fact that the expansion mutation lies outside of the protein-encoding gene elements , and should not be translated into protein . Here we use muscle biopsies from classical adult-onset myotonic dystrophy patients to study the accumulation of transcripts from both the normal and expanded DM kinase genes in patient muscle , and compare the results to normal and myopathic controls . We found relatively small decreases of DM kinase RNA in the total RNA pool from muscle ; however , these reductions were not disease specific . Analysis of poly ( A ) + RNA showed dramatic decreases of both the mutant and normal DM kinase RNAs , and these changes were disease-specific . Our findings are consistent with a novel molecular pathogenetic mechanism for myotonic dystrophy  both the normal and expanded DM kinase genes are transcribed in patient muscle , but the abnormal expansion-containing RNA has a dominant effect on RNA metabolism by preventing the accumulation of poly ( A ) + RNA .

A family study revealed complete C9 deficiency in the patients healthy brother and half-normal C9 concentrations in his sister , his son ( who also had experienced an episode of bacterial meningitis ) , and his niece , consistent with an inherited C9 deficiency .

A major gene locus for PLS has been mapped to a 2 . 8 cM interval on chromosome 11q14 . Correlation of physical and genetic maps of this interval indicate it includes at least 40 ESTs and six known genes including the lysosomal protease cathepsin C gene ( CTSC ) . The CTSC message is expressed at high levels in a variety of immune cells including polymorphonuclear leucocytes , macrophages , and their precursors . By RT-PCR , we found CTSC is also expressed in epithelial regions commonly affected by PLS , including the palms , soles , knees , and oral keratinised gingiva . The 4 . 7 kb CTSC gene consists of two exons . Sequence analysis of CTSC from subjects affected with PLS from five consanguineous Turkish families identified four different mutations . An exon 1 nonsense mutation ( 856C-- > T ) introduces a premature stop codon at amino acid 286 . Three exon 2 mutations were identified , including a single nucleotide deletion ( 2692delA ) of codon 349 introducing a frameshift and premature termination codon , a 2 bp deletion ( 2673-2674delCT ) that results in introduction of a stop codon at amino acid 343 , and a G-- > A substitution in codon 429 ( 2931G-- > A ) introducing a premature termination codon . All PLS patients were homozygous for cathepsin C mutations inherited from a common ancestor . Parents and sibs heterozygous for cathepsin C mutations do not show either the palmoplantar hyperkeratosis or severe early onset periodontitis characteristic of PLS . A more complete understanding of the functional physiology of cathepsin C carries significant implications for understanding normal and abnormal skin development and periodontal disease susceptibility \n "}}

Intact SLS fibroblasts incubated in the presence of [ 1-14C ] palmitate accumulated more radioactive hexadecanol than did normal cells , whereas incorporation of radioactivity into other cellular lipids was unaltered . The hexadecanol content of SLS fibroblasts was abnormally elevated . Hexadecanol accumulation was not due to increased fatty alcohol synthesis nor its deficient utilization for glycerol ether synthesis . The half-life of intracellular hexadecanol loaded into SLS fibroblasts was increased ( 70 min ) compared with normal ( 15 min ) , and intact SLS fibroblasts showed impaired oxidation of [ 14C ] -hexadecanol to fatty acid . Fatty alcohol  NAD + oxidoreductase , the enzyme catalyzing this reaction , was deficient in SLS fibroblasts . Mean total activity in SLS fibroblasts ( n = 5 ) was 13 % of that in normal fibroblasts , and palmitoyl CoA-inhibitable activity was 1 % of normal . Fibroblasts from two obligate SLS heterozygotes had enzyme activities intermediate between that in normal fibroblasts and individuals with SLS .

BACKGROUND  SEPs and MEPs have proved useful in revealing signs of progressively severe , central dying-back axonopathy in early stages of adult-onset ALD . METHODS  Eight patients with adult-onset ALD underwent clinical examination , brain and spine MRI , and SEP and MEP studies before and after 3 years of Lorenzos oil dietary therapy . RESULTS  Before treatment , brain MRI was normal in five patients . Three of these patients had pure spinal SEP abnormalities and in the remaining two patients SEPs showed signs of involvement of both the spinal and cerebral somatosensory tracts . After treatment , the three patients with pure spinal abnormalities showed clinical and neurophysiologic worsening , whereas the two patients with a more advanced stage of disease ( exhibited by SEPs ) showed substantially unchanged clinical and neurophysiologic features . The patients with abnormal brain MRI at the onset of treatment showed clinical and neurophysiologic worsening . CONCLUSIONS  Lorenzos oil therapy had no effect on patients with evidence of inflammatory brain lesions . Moreover , in patients without clear signs of inflammatory damage , this treatment does not modify significantly the natural course of the disease . However , because effective treatments should begin before the onset of severe neurologic symptoms , SEPs and MEPs should be considered to evaluate the effectiveness of other experimental treatments in the patient with a negative brain MRI .\n "}}

As yet , our understanding of HFE function in iron homeostasis is only partial ; an even more open question is its possible role in the immune system . To advance on both of these avenues , we report the deletion of HFE alpha1 and alpha2 putative ligand binding domains in vivo . HFE-deficient animals were analyzed for a comprehensive set of metabolic and immune parameters . Faithfully mimicking human hemochromatosis , mice homozygous for this deletion develop iron overload , characterized by a higher plasma iron content and a raised transferrin saturation as well as an elevated hepatic iron load . The primary defect could , indeed , be traced to an augmented duodenal iron absorption . In parallel , measurement of the gut mucosal iron content as well as iron regulatory proteins allows a more informed evaluation of various hypotheses regarding the precise role of HFE in iron homeostasis . Finally , an extensive phenotyping of primary and secondary lymphoid organs including the gut provides no compelling evidence for an obvious immune-linked function for HFE . . \n "}}

Clones hybridizing with cDNA for human ARSA were selected , examined for appropriate size inserts , and used to prepare single-stranded phage DNA . Examination of the entire coding and most of the intronic sequence revealed two putative disease-related mutations . One , a point mutation in exon 3 , resulted in the substitution of isoleucine by serine . Introduction of this alteration into the normal ARSA cDNA sequence resulted in a substantial decrease in ARSA activity on transient expression in cultured baby hamster kidney cells . About 5 % of the control expression was observed , suggesting a small residual activity in the mutated ARSA . The second mutation , a G-to-A transition , occurred in the other allele and resulted in an altered splice-recognition sequence between exon 7 and the following intron . The mutation also resulted in the loss of a restriction site . Apparently normal levels of mRNA were generated from this allele , but no ARSA activity or immuno-cross-reactive material could be detected . A collection of DNA samples from known or suspected MLD patients , members of their families , and normal controls was screened for these mutations . Four additional individuals carrying each of the mutations were found among the nearly 100 MLD patients in the sample . Gene segregation in the original patients family was consistent with available clinical and biochemical data . No individuals homozygous for either of these two mutations were identified . However , combinations with other MLD mutations suggest that the point mutation in exon 3 does result in some residual enzyme activity and is associated with late-onset forms of the disease . The splice-site mutation following exon 7 produces late-infantile MLD when combined with other enzyme-null mutations , implying that it is completely silent enzymatically . . \n "}}

Therefore , we screened eight familial gastric cancer kindreds of British and Irish origin for germline CDH1 mutations , by SSCP analysis of all 16 exons and flanking sequences . Each family contained  ( i ) two cases of gastric cancer in first degree relatives with one affected before age 50 years ; or ( ii ) three or more cases of gastric cancer .

In one family there was evidence of non-penetrance and susceptibility to both gastric and colorectal cancer ; thus , in addition to six cases of gastric cancer , a CDH1 mutation carrier developed colorectal cancer at age 30 years . We have confirmed that germline mutations in the CDH1 gene cause familial gastric cancer in non-Maori populations . However , only a minority of familial gastric cancers can be accounted for by CDH1 mutations . Loss of E-cadherin function has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sporadic colorectal and other cancers , and our findings provide evidence that germline CDH1 mutations predispose to early onset colorectal cancer .

The c862t ( R279W ) transition is the most common mutation in non-Finnish patients , but in these disorders it is usually combined with other DTDST mutations . We had not seen a case of homozygosity for c862t ( R279W ) until we analysed DNA from a 36 year old male with tall-normal stature ( 180 cm ) who asked for genetic counselling for suspected multiple epiphyseal dysplasia . He was treated for club foot and hip dysplasia at birth . Skeletal changes consistent with multiple epiphyseal dysplasia , with the peculiar finding of a double layered patella , were recognised during childhood . Cleft palate , swelling of the ear pinna , and hitch hiker thumb were absent . He was found to be homozygous , and both healthy parents heterozygous , for the R279W mutation in DTDST , and his fibroblasts showed a sulphate incorporation defect typical of DTDST disorders . Counselling was given for a recessive disorder , thereby considerably reducing the probability of affected offspring . Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia is more frequently caused by dominant mutations in the COMP ( EDM1 , McKusick 132400 ) and COL9A2 genes ( EDM2 , McKusick 600204 ) . A few other patients and families with features similar to our proband have been described previously and considered to have autosomal recessive MED ( EDM4 , McKusick 226900 ) .

The unambiguous identification of a crossover event within hemochromatosis families is very difficult ; it is particularly hampered by the variability of the phenotypic expression as well as by the sex- and age-related penetrance of the disease . For these practical considerations , traditional linkage analysis could prove of limited value in further refining the extrapolated physical position of HFE . We therefore embarked upon a linkage-disequilibrium analysis of HFE and normal chromosomes from the Brittany population . In the present report , 66 hemochromatosis families yielding 151 hemochromatosis chromosomes and 182 normal chromosomes were RFLP-typed with a battery of probes , including two newly derived polymorphic markers from the 6 . 7 and HLA-F loci located 150 and 250 kb telomeric to HLA-A , respectively . The results suggest a strong peak of existing linkage disequilibrium focused within the i82-to-6 . 7 interval ( approximately 250 kb ) . The zone of linkage disequilibrium is flanked by the i97 locus , positioned 30 kb proximal to i82 , and the HLA-F gene , found 250 kb distal to HLA-A , markers of which display no significant association with HFE . These data support the possibility that HFE resides within the 400-kb expanse of DNA between i97 and HLA-F . Alternatively , the very tight association of HLA-A3 and allele 1 of the 6 . 7 locus , both of which are comprised by the major ancestral or founder HFE haplotype in Brittany , supports the possibility that the disease gene may reside immediately telomeric to the 6 . 7 locus within the linkage-disequilibrium zone . Additionally , hemochromatosis haplotypes possessing HLA-A11 and the low-frequency HLA-F polymorphism ( allele 2 ) are supportive of a separate founder chromosome containing a second , independently arising mutant allele . Overall , the establishment of a likely \" hemochromatosis critical region \" centromeric boundary and the identification of a linkage-disequilibrium zone both significantly contribute to a reduction in the amount of DNA required to be searched for novel coding sequences constituting the HFE defect \n "}}

Mutations in this gene are responsible for Pendred syndrome and autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss at the DFNB4 locus on chromosome 7q31 . A screen of 20 individuals from the midwestern USA with non-syndromic hearing loss and dilated vestibular aqueducts identified three people ( 15 % ) with PDS mutations . To determine whether PDS mutations in individuals with Pendred syndrome differ functionally from PDS mutations in individuals with non-syndromic hearing loss , we compared three common Pendred syndrome allele variants ( L236P , T416P and E384G ) , with three PDS mutations reported only in individuals with non-syndromic hearing loss ( V480D , V653A and I490L / G497S ) . The mutations associated with Pendred syndrome have complete loss of pendrin-induced chloride and iodide transport , while alleles unique to people with DFNB4 are able to transport both iodide and chloride , albeit at a much lower level than wild-type pendrin . We hypothesize that this residual level of anion transport is sufficient to eliminate or postpone the onset of goiter in individuals with DFNB4 . We propose a model for pendrin function in the thyroid in which pendrin transports iodide across the apical membrane of the thyrocyte into the colloid space . . \n "}}

Almost all APC mutations that have been identified are single-nucleotide alterations , small insertions , or small deletions that would truncate the protein product of the gene . No well-characterized intragenic rearrangement of APC has been described , and the prevalence of this type of mutation in FAP patients is not clear . We screened 49 potential FAP families and identified 26 different germline APC mutations in 30 families . Four of these mutations were genomic rearrangements resulting from homologous and nonhomologous recombinations mediated by Alu elements . Two of these four rearrangements were complex , involving deletion and insertion of nucleotides . Of these four rearrangements , one resulted in the deletion of exons 11 and 12 and two others resulted in either complete or partial deletion of exon 14 . The fourth rearrangement grossly altered the sequence within intron 14 . Although this rearrangement did not affect any coding sequence of APC at the genomic DNA level , it caused inappropriate splicing of exon 14 . These rearrangements were initially revealed by analyzing cDNAs and could not have been identified by using mutation detection methods that screened each exon individually . The identification of a rearrangement that did not alter any coding exons yet affected the splicing further underscores the importance of using cDNA for mutation analysis .

To identify the mutations which inactivate RB1 , 21 RB tumors isolated from 19 patients were analyzed with the polymerase chain reaction or an RNase protection assay or both . Mutations were identified in 13 of 21 RB tumors ; in 8 tumors , the precise errors in nucleotide sequence were characterized . Each of four germ line mutations involved a small deletion or duplication , while three somatic mutations were point mutations leading to splice alterations and loss of an exon from the mature RB1 mRNA . We were unable to detect expression of the mutant allele in lymphoblasts of three bilaterally affected patients , although the mutation was present in the genomic DNA and transcripts containing the mutations were obvious in the RB tumors in the absence of a normal RB1 allele . The variations in the level of expression of mutant transcripts suggest deregulation of RB1 transcription in the absence of a functional RB1 gene product . . \n "}}

The plasma cholesteryl-ester transfer protein ( CETP ) catalyzes the transfer of cholesteryl esters from high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) to other lipoproteins . We recently described a Japanese family with increased HDL levels and CETP deficiency due to a splicing defect of the CETP gene . To assess the frequency and phenotype of this condition , we screened 11 additional families with high HDL levels by means of a radioimmunoassay for CETP and DNA analysis . RESULTS . We found the same CETP gene mutation in four families from three different regions of Japan . Analysis of restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms of the mutant CETP allele showed that all probands were homozygous for the identical haplotype . Family members homozygous for CETP deficiency ( n = 10 ) had moderate hypercholesterolemia ( mean total cholesterol level [ + / - SD ] , 7 . 01 + / - 0 . 83 mmol per liter ) , markedly increased levels of HDL cholesterol ( 4 . 24 + / - 1 . 01 mmol per liter ) and apolipoprotein A-I , and decreased levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( 1 . 99 + / - 0 . 80 mmol per liter ) and apolipoprotein B . Members heterozygous for the deficiency ( n = 20 ) , whose CETP levels were in the lower part of the normal range , had moderately increased levels of HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I and an increased ratio of HDL subclass 2 to HDL subclass 3 , as compared with unaffected family members ( 1 . 5 + / - 0 . 8 vs . 0 . 7 + / - 0 . 4 ) . CETP deficiency was not found in six unrelated subjects with elevated HDL cholesterol levels who were from different parts of the United States . CONCLUSIONS . CETP deficiency appears to be a frequent cause of increased HDL levels in the population of Japan , possibly because of a founder effect . The results that we observed in heterozygotes suggest that CETP normally plays a part in the regulation of levels of HDL subclass 2 . There was no evidence of premature atherosclerosis in the families with CETP deficiency . In fact , the lipoprotein profile of persons with CETP deficiency is potentially antiatherogenic and may be associated with an increased life span .  \n "}}

In this study , we have characterized MAGEL2 ( also known as NDNL1 ) , a gene with 51 % amino acid sequence similarity to necdin and located 41 kb distal to NDN in the PWS deletion region . MAGEL2 is expressed predominantly in brain , the primary tissue affected in PWS and in several fetal tissues as shown by northern blot analysis . MAGEL2 is imprinted with monoallelic expression in control brain , and paternal-only expression in the central nervous system as demonstrated by its lack of expression in brain from a PWS-affected individual . The orthologous mouse gene ( Magel2 ) is located within 150 kb of NDN  , is imprinted with paternal-only expression and is expressed predominantly in late developmental stages and adult brain as shown by northern blotting , RT-PCR and whole-mount RNA in situ hybridization . Magel2 distribution partially overlaps that of NDN  , with strong expression being detected in the central nervous system in mid-gestation mouse embryos by in situ hybridization . We hypothesize that , although loss of necdin expression may be important in the neonatal presentation of PWS , loss of MAGEL2 may be critical to abnormalities in brain development and dysmorphic features in individuals with PWS . . \n "}}

Biological properties of C5-deficient human serum.\tThe first known human kindred with hereditary deficiency of the fifth component of complement ( C5 ) was documented in the accompanying report . This study examines several biological properties of C5-deficient ( C5D ) human serum , particularly sera obtained from two C5D homozygotes . The proband , who has inactive systemic lupus erythematosus is completely lacking C5 , while her healthy half-sister has 1-2 % of normal levels . Both sera were severely impaired in their ability to generate chemotactic activity for normal human neutrophils upon incubation with aggregated human gamma-globulin or Escherichia coli endotoxin . This function was fully restored in the siblings serum , and substantially improved in the probands serum , by addition of highly purified human C5 to normal serum concentrations . Sera from eight family members who were apparently heterozygous for C5 deficiency gave normal chemotactic scores . The ability of C5D serum to opsonize Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( bakers yeast ) or Candida albicans for ingestion by normal neutrophils was completely normal . In addition , C5D serum was capable of promoting normal phagocytosis and intracellular killing of Staphylococcus aureus . The probands serum was incapable of mediating lysis of erythrocytes from a patient with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria in both the sucrose hemolysia and acid hemolysis tests , and also lacked bactericidal activity against sensitized or unsensitized Salmonella typhi . The siblings serum , containing only 1-2 % of normal C5 , effectively lysed S . typhi , but only at eightfold lower serum dilutions as compared to normals . These findings underscore the critical role of C5 in the generation of chemotactic activity and in cytolytic reactions , as opposed to a nonobligatory or minimal role in opsonization , at least for the organisms under study . . \n "}}

In addition , the mice manifest several characteristics that are occasionally observed in human hypobetalipoproteinemia , including reduced plasma triglyceride concentrations , fasting chylomicronemia , and reduced high density lipoprotein cholesterol . An unexpected finding is that the modified Apob allele is strongly associated with exencephalus and hydrocephalus . These mice should help increase our understanding of hypobetalipoproteinemia , atherogenesis , and the etiology of exencephalus and hydrocephalus . . \n "}}

The predicted rodent proteins have several important domains and signals found in human pyrin , including a B-box zinc finger domain , Robbins-Dingwall nuclear localization signal , and coiled-coil domain .

The structural gene for AGA has been assigned to the region 4q21-qter of chromosome 4 . We have studied the map position of the AGU locus in relation to other marker loci on the long arm of chromosome 4 using linkage analyses . Restriction fragment length polymorphism alleles for the ADH2 , ADH3 , EGF , FG alpha and FG beta loci and blood group antigens for the MNS locus were determined in a panel of 12 Finnish AGU families . The heterozygous family members were identified by reduced activity of AGA in lymphocytes . Linkage studies were performed using both pairwise and multipoint analyses .

In this family of disorders , a normally polymorphic CAG repeat becomes expanded , resulting in expression of an expanded polyglutamine domain in the disease gene product . Experimental models of polyglutamine disease implicate the nucleus in pathogenesis ; however , the link between intranuclear expression of expanded polyglutamine and neuronal dysfunction remains unclear . Here we demonstrate that ataxin-3 , the disease protein in SCA3 / MJD , adopts a unique conformation when expressed within the nucleus of transfected cells . The monoclonal antibody 1C2 is known preferentially to bind expanded polyglutamine , but we find that it also binds a fragment of ataxin-3 containing a normal glutamine repeat . In addition , expression of ataxin-3 within the nucleus exposes the glutamine domain of the full-length non-pathological protein , allowing it to bind the monoclonal antibody 1C2 . Fractionation and immunochemical experiments indicate that this novel conformation of intranuclear ataxin-3 is not due to proteolysis , suggesting instead that association with nuclear protein ( s ) alters the structure of full-length ataxin-3 which exposes the polyglutamine domain . This conformationally altered ataxin-3 is bound to the nuclear matrix . The pathological form of ataxin-3 with an expanded polyglutamine domain also associates with the nuclear matrix . These data suggest that an early event in the pathogenesis of SCA3 / MJD may be an altered conformation of ataxin-3 within the nucleus that exposes the polyglutamine domain . . \n "}}

Loss of expression of imprinted , paternally expressed genes has been implicated in PWS . However , the number of imprinted genes that contribute to PWS , and the range over which the imprinting signal acts to silence one copy of the gene in a parent-of-origin-specific manner , are unknown . To identify additional imprinted genes that could contribute to the PWS phenotype and to understand the regional control of imprinting in 15q11-q13 , we have constructed an imprinted transcript map of the PWS-AS deletion interval . The imprinting status of 22 expressed sequence tags derived from the radiation-hybrid human transcript maps or physical maps was determined in a reverse transcriptase-PCR assay and correlated with the position of the transcripts on the physical map . Seven new paternally expressed transcripts localize to an approximately 1 . 5-Mb domain surrounding the SNRPN-associated imprinting center , which already includes four imprinted , paternally expressed genes . All other tested new transcripts in the deletion region were expressed from both alleles . A domain of exclusive paternal expression surrounding the imprinting center suggests strong regional control of the imprinting process . This study provides the means for further investigation of additional genes that cause or modify the phenotypes associated with rearrangements of 15q11-q13 . \n "}}

The genetic defect is a CTG triplet repeat expansion in the 3-untranslated region of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase ( DMPK ) gene , consisting of 15 exons . Using a transgenic DMPK-overexpressor mouse model , we demonstrate here that the endogenous mouse DMPK gene and the human DMPK transgene produce six major alternatively spliced mRNAs which have almost identical cell type-dependent distribution frequencies and expression patterns . Use of a cryptic 5 splice site in exon 8 , which results in absence or presence of 15 nucleotides specifying a VSGGG peptide motif , and / or use of a cryptic 3 splice site in exon 14 , which leads to a frameshift in the mRNA reading frame , occur as independent stochastic events in all tissues examined . In contrast , the excision of exons 13 / 14 that causes a frameshift and creates a C-terminally truncated protein is clearly cell type dependent and occurs predominantly in smooth muscle . We generated all six full-length mouse cDNAs that result from combinations of these three major splicing events and show that their transfection into cells in culture leads to production of four different approximately 74 kDa full-length ( heart- , skeletal muscle- or brain-specific ) and two C-terminally truncated approximately 68 kDa ( smooth muscle-specific ) isoforms .

The principal biochemical abnormality is the accumulation of saturated very-long-chain fatty acids ( VLCFAs  > C22  0 , mainly C26  0 ) , which is due to impaired capacity for beta-oxidation in peroxisomes . Diagnosis is usually based on the VLCFA levels in plasma or cultured skin fibroblasts in both patients and carriers .

Effective mutation detection in these families is therefore fundamental to unambiguously determine the genetic status of each individual at risk . Of particular concern are female members of kindreds segregating X-ALD mutations , because normal VLCFA levels do not guarantee lack of carrier status .

We analysed the age incidence curves for symptomatic renal cell carcinoma ( n = 26 ) and cerebellar haemangioblastoma ( n = 68 ) in 109 patients with von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) disease , and compared them to 104 patients with sporadic renal cell carcinoma and 43 patients with sporadic cerebellar haemangioblastoma . The age incidence curves for renal cell carcinoma and cerebellar haemangioblastoma in VHL disease were compatible with a single mutation model , whereas the age incidence curves for sporadic renal cell carcinoma and cerebellar haemangioblastoma suggested a two stage mutation process . These data are compatible with the VHL gene functioning as a recessive tumour suppressor gene .

The mutation ( A-- > T at nt943 + 3 ) disrupts the 3 splice site of exon 5 leading to the deletion of this exon from MSH2 mRNA and represents the only frequent MSH2 mutation so far reported . Although this mutation was initially detected in four of 33 colorectal cancer families analysed from eastern England , more extensive analysis has reduced the frequency to four of 52 ( 8 % ) English HNPCC kindreds analysed . In contrast , the MSH2 mutation was identified in 10 of 20 ( 50 % ) separately identified colorectal families from Newfoundland . To investigate the origin of this mutation in colorectal cancer families from England ( n = 4 ) , Newfoundland ( n = 10 ) , and the United States ( n = 3 ) , haplotype analysis using microsatellite markers linked to MSH2 was performed . Within the English and US families there was little evidence for a recent common origin of the MSH2 splice site mutation in most families . In contrast , a common haplotype was identified at the two flanking markers ( CA5 and D2S288 ) in eight of the Newfoundland families . These findings suggested a founder effect within Newfoundland similar to that reported by others for two MLH1 mutations in Finnish HNPCC families .

The OCRL protein is 51 % identical to inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase II ( 5-phosphatase II ) from human platelets over a span of 744 aa , suggesting that OCRL may be a similar enzyme . We engineered a construct of the OCRL cDNA that encodes amino acids homologous to the platelet 5-phosphatase for expression in baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells . This cDNA encodes aa 264-968 of the OCRL protein . The recombinant protein was found to catalyze the reactions also carried out by platelet 5-phosphatase II . Thus OCRL converts inositol 1 , 4 , 5-trisphosphate to inositol 1 , 4-bisphosphate , and it converts inositol 1 , 3 , 4 , 5-tetrakisphosphate to inositol 1 , 3 , 4-trisphosphate . Most important , the enzyme converts phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5-bisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate . The relative ability of OCRL to catalyze the three reactions is different from that of 5-phosphatase II and from that of another 5-phosphatase isoenzyme from platelets , 5-phosphatase I . The recombinant OCRL protein hydrolyzes the phospholipid substrate 10- to 30-fold better than 5-phosphatase II , and 5-phosphatase I does not cleave the lipid at all . We also show that OCRL functions as a phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5-bisphosphate 5-phosphatase in OCRL-expressing Sf9 cells . These results suggest that OCRL is mainly a lipid phosphatase that may control cellular levels of a critical metabolite , phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5-bisphosphate .

The first allele suffers a mutational event--deletion , duplication or point mutation ( manuscript in preparation ) --either in the germ line ( all bilateral patients ) or in a somatic retinal cell ( most unilateral patients ) .

Six tumours retained the paternal allele and three retained the maternal allele . Of the three unilateral tumours , only one retained the paternal RB1 allele . Thus , there is no evidence that the paternal RB1 allele is preferentially retained in retinoblastoma , as has been suggested to be the case in osteosarcoma .

VCFS / DGS is the most common syndrome associated with 22q11 rearrangements . In order to determine whether there are particular regions on 22q11 that are prone to rearrangements , the deletion end-points in a large number of VCFS / DGS patients were defined by haplotype analysis . Most VCFS / DGS patients have a similar 3 Mb deletion , some have a nested distal deletion breakpoint resulting in a 1 . 5 Mb deletion and a few rare patients have unique deletions or translocations . The high prevalence of the disorder in the population and the fact that most cases occur sporadically suggest that sequences at or near the breakpoints confer susceptibility to chromosome rearrangements . To investigate this hypothesis , we developed hamster-human somatic hybrid cell lines from VCFS / DGS patients with all three classes of deletions and we now show that the breakpoints occur within similar low copy repeats , termed LCR22s . To support this idea further , we identified a family that carries an interstitial duplication of the same 3 Mb region that is deleted in VCFS / DGS patients . We present models to explain how the LCR22s can mediate different homologous recombination events , thereby generating a number of rearrangements that are associated with congenital anomaly disorders .

PWS is due to a lack of paternal genetic information at 15q11-q13 ( ref . 2 ) . Five imprinted , paternally expressed genes map to the PWS region , MKRN3 ( ref . 3 ) , NDN ( ref . 4 ) , NDNL1 ( ref . 5 ) , SNRPN ( refs 6-8 ) and IPW ( ref . 9 ) , as well as two poorly characterized framents designated PAR-1 and PAR-5 ( ref . 10 ) . Imprinting of this region involves a bipartite imprinting centre ( IC ) , which overlaps SNRPN ( refs 10 , 11 ) . Deletion of the SNRPN promoter / exon 1 region ( the PWS IC element ) appears to impair the establishment of the paternal imprint in the male germ line and leads to PWS . Here we report a PWS family in which the father is mosaic for an IC deletion on his paternal chromosome . The deletion chromosome has acquired a maternal methylation imprint in his somatic cells . We have made identical findings in chimaeric mice generated from two independent embryonic stem ( ES ) cell lines harbouring a similar deletion . Our studies demonstrate that the PWS IC element is not only required for the establishment of the paternal imprint , but also for its postzygotic maintenance . . \n "}}

Neurological mutant mice can often provide model systems for human genetic disorders . Mutations of the X-chromosome-linked PLP gene are lethal , identified first in the jimpy mouse and subsequently in patients with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease . The unexplained phenotype of these mutations includes degeneration and premature cell death of oligodendrocytes with associated hypomyelination . Here we show that a new mouse mutant rumpshaker is defined by the amino-acid substitution Ile-to-Thr at residue 186 in a membrane-embedded domain of PLP . Surprisingly , rumpshaker mice , although myelin-deficient , have normal longevity and a full complement of morphologically normal oligodendrocytes . Hypomyelination can thus be genetically separated from the PLP-dependent oligodendrocyte degeneration . We suggest that PLP has a vital function in glial cell development , distinct from its later role in myelin assembly , and that this dichotomy of action may explain the clinical spectrum of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease . . \n "}}

To elucidate the range of WASP mutations responsible for WAS , we used PCR-SSCP analysis to screen for WASP gene mutation in 19 unrelated boys with the diagnosis of classical or attenuated WAS or isolated thrombocytopenia . All 19 patients had WASP mutations , each of which localized to the initial three or terminal three exons of the gene , and the majority of which were unique in each case . However , a missense mutation which results in substitution of the arginine at WAS codon 86 was identified in three boys with severe WAS as well as in one boy presenting with thrombocytopenia alone . While the three mutations found in the isolated thrombocytopenia patients leave the reading frame intact , about one-half of the gene alterations detected in both severe and attenuated WAS patients result in frameshifted transcript and premature translation termination . These findings therefore confirm the association of WAS with WASP mutation and identify WASP mutation as a cause for isolated congenital thrombocytopenia in males . While the WASP gene defects responsible for isolated thrombocytopenia and other mild presentations of WAS do not appear distinct from those resulting in severe WAS , these data indicate that analysis of WASP gene mutation provides a valuable tool for distinguishing the spectrum of WAS patients and the subset of males with isolated thrombocytopenia who represent mild cases of WAS . . \n "}}

On the basis of these criteria , 48 % of the PWS individuals were hypopigmented . The presence of hypopigmentation correlated with a small interstitial deletion on the proximal long arm of chromosome 15 ; however , this deletion was also found in individuals who did not meet the full criteria for hypopigmentation .

This study was carried out to further evaluate this risk among patients with CHH and their first-degree relatives . STUDY DESIGN  One hundred twenty-two patients with CHH were identified through 2 countrywide epidemiologic surveys in 1974 and in 1986 . Their parents and nonaffected siblings were identified through the Population Register Center . This cohort underwent follow-up for cancer incidence through the Finnish Cancer Registry to the end of 1995 . RESULTS  A statistically significant excess risk of cancer was seen among the patients with CHH ( standardized incidence ratio 6 . 9 , 95 % confidence interval 2 . 3 to 16 ) , which was mainly attributable to non-Hodgkins lymphoma  ( standardized incidence ratio 90 , 95 % confidence interval 18 to 264 ) . In addition , a significant excess risk of basal cell carcinoma was seen ( standardized incidence ratio 35 , 95 % confidence interval 7 . 2 to 102 ) . The cancer incidence among the siblings or the parents did not differ from the average cancer incidence in the Finnish population . CONCLUSIONS  This study confirms an increased risk of cancer, especially non-Hodgkins lymphoma , probably attributable to defective immunity , among patients with CHH .\n "}}

The genetic defect in DM is a CTG repeat expansion located in the 3 untranslated region of DMPK and 5 of a homeodomain-encoding gene , SIX5 ( formerly DMAHP ; refs 2-5 ) . There are three mechanisms by which CTG expansion can result in DM . First , repeat expansion may alter the processing or transport of the mutant DMPK mRNA and consequently reduce DMPK levels . Second , CTG expansion may establish a region of heterochromatin 3 of the repeat sequence and decrease SIX5 transcription . Third , toxic effects of the repeat expansion may be intrinsic to the repeated elements at the level of DNA or RNA ( refs 10 , 11 ) . Previous studies have demonstrated that a dose-dependent loss of Dm15 ( the mouse DMPK homologue ) in mice produces a partial DM phenotype characterized by decreased development of skeletal muscle force and cardiac conduction disorders . To test the role of Six5 loss in DM , we have analysed a strain of mice in which Six5 was deleted . Our results demonstrate that the rate and severity of cataract formation is inversely related to Six5 dosage and is temporally progressive . Six5 + / - and Six5- / - mice show increased steady-state levels of the Na + / K + -ATPase alpha-1 subunit and decreased Dm15 mRNA levels . Thus , altered ion homeostasis within the lens may contribute to cataract formation . As ocular cataracts are a characteristic feature of DM , these results demonstrate that decreased SIX5 transcription is important in the aetiology of DM . Our data support the hypothesis that DM is a contiguous gene syndrome associated with the partial loss of both DMPK and SIX5 . . \n "}}

The location of the germ-line mutations seems to correlate with the two clinical types ; germ-line mutations in five FAP patients with profuse polyps were observed between codon 1250 and codon 1464 , whereas mutations in 17 FAP patients with fewer polyps were observed in the other regions of the APC gene .

The expression of CYP27 has been mostly explored using cultured fibroblasts , prompting the examination of the transcripts from blood leucocytes as a simple and rapid technique . METHODS  An alteration in CYP27 of the proband was searched for by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism ( PCR-SSCP ) analysis and subsequent sequencing .

RESULTS  A homozygous G to A transition at the 5 end of intron 7 was detected in the patient . In RT-PCR analysis , only a truncated transcript was detected in the patient , whereas both normal and truncated transcripts were detected in the siblings . The sequencing of the patients cDNA fragment disclosed a direct conjuction of exon 6 and exon 8 .

Direct sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction-derived DNAs of 6 of 24 specimens revealed a codon 877 mutation ( ACT-- > GCT , Thr-- > Ala ) in the hormone-binding domain of the AR gene . This same AR mutation has been reported previously in a metastatic prostate cancer cell line , LNCaP , where this mutation confers upon the AR an altered ligand-binding specificity which is stimulated by estrogens , progestagens , and antiandrogens . It is possible that analogous to an activated / altered growth factor receptor oncogene , codon 877 mutant AR with altered ligand binding may provide a selective growth advantage in the genesis of a subset of advanced prostate cancer .

Single-sperm typing techniques were performed for each sample by study of two informative short tandem repeats located either in or close to the retinoblastoma gene ( RB1 ) .

The segregation distortion favoring the mutant RB1 allele does not seem to occur during spermatogenesis , and , thus , meiotic drive may result either from various mechanisms , including a fertilization advantage or a better mobility in sperm bearing a mutant RB1 gene , or from the existence of a defectively imprinted gene located on the human X chromosome .\n "}}

Second , the expanded allele associated with MJD displays inter-generational instability , particularly in male meioses , and this instability was associated with the clinical phenomenon of anticipation . Third , the size of the expanded allele is not only inversely correlated with the age-of-onset of MJD ( r = -0 . 738 , p < 0 . 001 ) , but is also correlated with the frequency of other clinical features [ e . g g . pseudoexophthalmos and pyramidal signs were more frequent in subjects with large repeats ( p < 0 . 10\t001 and p < 0 . 05 respectively ) ] . Fourth , the disease phenotype is significantly more severe and had an early age of onset ( 16 years ) in a subject homozygous for the expanded allele , which contrasts with Huntington disease and suggests that the expanded allele in the MJD1 gene could exert its effect either by a dominant negative effect ( putatively excluded in HD ) or by a gain of function effect as proposed for HD .

Cell fusion complementation studies demonstrated that these diseases are genetically heterogeneous , with two-thirds of all patients lying within a single complementation group , CG1 . Molecular genetic and cell biology studies have shown that PEX1 is deficient in many CG1 patients . However , previous studies have focused on mildly affected patients and there is still no report of two mutant PEX1 alleles in any Zellweger syndrome patient . Furthermore , mutations in the PMP70 gene have also been identified in two Zellweger syndrome patients from CG1 , raising the possibility that CG1 patients may represent a mixture of PEX1-deficient and PMP70-deficient individuals . To address the molecular basis of disease in Zellweger syndrome patients from CG1 , we examined all 24 PEX1 exons in four patients , including both patients that have mutations in PMP70 . PEX1 mutations were detected in all four patients , including a 1-bp insertion ( c . 2097insT ) in exon 13 that was present in three of the four patients . Subsequent studies demonstrated that this mutation is present in one-half of all CG1 patients and correlates with the Zellweger syndrome phenotype . As this mutation leads to a loss of protein function its frequency makes it the most common cause of Zellweger syndrome , helping to explain the high percentage of patients that belong to CG1 . \n "}}

We aimed to determine whether the common germline mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 in Ashkenazi Jewish men predisposed them to prostate cancer . METHODS  We examined genomic DNA from 83 ( for BRCA1 185delAG ) or 82 ( for BRCA2 6174delT ) Ashkenazi Jewish prostate cancer patients , most of whom were treated at a relatively young age , for the most common germline mutation in each gene seen in the Ashkenazi population . RESULTS  Our study should have been able to detect a 4-5-fold increase in the risk of prostate cancer due to mutation of BRCA1 or BRCA2 . However , only one ( 1 . 15 % ; 95 % confidence interval , 0-3 . 6 % ) of the patients was heterozygous for the BRCA1 mutant allele , and only two were heterozygous for the BRCA2 mutation ( 2 . 4 % ; 95 % confidence interval , 0-6 . 2 % ) . CONCLUSIONS  The incidence of each of the germline mutations in these prostate cancer patients closely matched their incidence ( about 1 % ) in the general Ashkenazi Jewish population . This suggests that unlike cases of breast and ovarian cancers , mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 do not significantly predispose men to prostate cancer \n "}}

Several novel as well as previously reported uncharacterized variants were also identified , some of which were associated with a family history of cancer .

Southern blots of restriction endonuclease digests and gene dosage analysis measurements carried out with quantitative slot blots of undigested genomic DNA separated these patients into three groups . The first group consisted of a family with complete homozygous deletions of the vWF gene in the four probands . Gene dosage analysis was consistent with heterozygous deletions in both of the asymptomatic parents and four asymptomatic siblings of this kindred ( P less than 0 . 01 ) . The second group was comprised of a family in which there was a complete heterozygous deletion of the vWF gene in the proband and one asymptomatic parent , suggesting that a different type of genetic abnormality was inherited from the other parent . Thus , the patient appeared to be doubly heterozygous for interacting genetic abnormalities affecting vWF expression . In the third group , no gene deletions could be detected . Alloantibodies developed only in the kindred with homozygous deletions . These techniques should prove useful in identifying carriers of severe von Willebrand disease and also in defining patients predictably at risk of developing alloantibodies to vWF . \n "}}

We analyzed the entire protein-coding sequence of this gene by reverse-transcription PCR , SSCP , and DNA sequencing in five patients with different clinical expression of X-ALD and in their female relatives ; these clinical expressions were cerebral childhood ALD , adrenomyeloneuropathy ( AMN ) , and \" Addison disease only \" ( ADO ) phenotype . In the three patients exhibiting the classical picture of severe childhood ALD we identified in the 5 portion of the X-ALD gene a 38-bp deletion that causes a frameshift mutation , a 3-bp deletion leading to a deletion of an amino acid in the ATP-binding domain of the ALD protein , and a missense mutation . In the patient with the clinical phenotype of AMN , a nonsense mutation in codon 212 , along with a second site mutation at codon 178 , was observed . Analysis of the patient with the ADO phenotype revealed a further missense mutation at a highly conserved position in the ALDP / PMP70 comparison . The disruptive nature of two mutations ( i . e . , the frameshift and the nonsense mutation ) in patients with biochemically proved childhood ALD and AMN further strongly supports the hypothesis that alterations in this gene play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of X-ALD . Since the current biochemical techniques for X-ALD carrier detection in affected families lack sufficient reliability , our procedure described for systematic mutation scanning is also capable of improving genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis \n "}}

Detailed analysis of genomic deletions in Norrie patients shows that they are heterogeneous , both in size and in position . By PCR analysis , we found that expression of the NDP gene was not confined to the eye or to the brain . An extensive DNA and protein sequence comparison between the human NDP gene and related genes from the database revealed homology with cysteine-rich protein-binding domains of immediate--early genes implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation .

A gene , FGD1 , altered in a patient with AAS phenotype , has been identified and found to encode a protein with homology to Rho / Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( Rho / Rac GEF ) . However , since this original report on identification of a mutated FGD1 gene in an AAS patient , no additional mutations in the FGD1 gene have been described . We analysed 13 independent patients with clinical diagnosis of AAS .

The mutation was found to segregate with the AAS phenotype in affected males and carrier females in the family of this patient . Interestingly , Arg-610 is located within one of the two pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domains of the FGD1 gene and it corresponds to a highly conserved residue which has been involved in InsP binding in PH domains of other proteins . The same residue is often mutated in the Brutons tyrosine kinase ( Btk ) gene in patients with an X-linked agammaglobulinemia .

This follow up study provides data on 35 gene carriers and 46 asymptomatic at risk family members in five generations . Clinical anticipation , defined as the cascade of mild , adult , childhood , or congenital disease in subsequent generations , appeared to be a relentless process , occurring in all affected branches of the family . The cascade was found to proceed asynchronously in the different branches , mainly because of an unequal number of generations with mild disease . The transition from the mild to the adult type was associated with transmission through a male parent . Stable transmission of the asymptomatic / mild phenotype showed a female transmission bias . We further examined the extent and causes of gene loss in this pedigree . Gene loss in the patient group was complete , owing to infertility of the male patients with adult onset disease and the fact that mentally retarded patients did not procreate . Out of the 46 at risk subjects in the two youngest generations , only one was found to have a full mutation . This is the only subject who may transmit the gene to the sixth generation . No protomutation carriers were found in the fourth and fifth generations . Therefore it is highly probable that the DM gene will be eliminated from this pedigree within one generation .

We have overcome this problem by studying a cohort of patients from a single center where the diagnosis was confirmed at the genetic level . Twenty-eight index patients with protein S deficiency and a PROS1 gene defect were studied , together with 109 first-degree relatives . To avoid selection bias , we confined analysis of total and free protein S levels and thrombotic risk to the patients relatives . In this group of relatives , a low free protein S level was the most reliable predictor of a PROS1 gene defect ( sensitivity 97 . 7 % , specificity 100 % ) . First-degree relatives with a PROS1 gene defect had a 5 . 0-fold higher risk of thrombosis ( 95 % confidence interval , 1 . 5-16 . 8 ) than those with a normal PROS1 gene and no other recognized thrombophilic defect . Although pregnancy / puerperium and immobility / trauma were important precipitating factors for thrombosis , almost half of the events were spontaneous . Relatives with splice-site or major structural defects in the PROS1 gene were more likely to have had a thrombotic event and had significantly lower total and free protein S levels than those relatives having missense mutations .
